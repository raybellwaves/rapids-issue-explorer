They are not the same thing.  Because of how CUDF works I don't think we can ever truly support this the same way. I would not mind exposing cudf specific configs that a user could modify, but they would not map 1 to 1 with the actual parquet configs.\r\n\r\nInstead we need to at least warn users if they set this to a non-default value.",
