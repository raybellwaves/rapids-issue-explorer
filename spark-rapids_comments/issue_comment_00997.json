        "body": "spark properties are for configuration of spark, it's not really for state information on the nodes you run on.  there is the runtime information, but that is easier because it should be global. The data you are asking for here could be different per executor. Executors can come and go with dynamic allocation and failures.  Really this is more of a spark generic feature request because you could want this for cpu type disk type, network type, etc.. There are some monitoring things spark has with metrics but none that cover this. \r\n\r\nThis could also potentially be done in the executor plugins if you have somewhere to report it too and it wouldn't be the event log.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately not a real easy way to do this right now and ideally would probably be part of the executor registration information",
