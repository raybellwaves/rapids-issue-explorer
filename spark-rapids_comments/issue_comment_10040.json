        "body": "Another aspect to consider: When you pass a Python `datetime` object with timezone information, then it will be converted to UTC before sending it Spark. This produces an `date value out of range` Python exception.  \r\n\r\nHowever, this also means that the effective range for testing dates for timestamps which have positive offset from UTC is actually restricted. You can only start `datetime` values at `0001-01-01 00:00:00.000000` UTC time, so a time that is `0001-01-01 00:00:00.000000` in a local timezone ahead of UTC cannot actually be sent back to Spark from Python because it will be converted to UTC before sending to Spark (which will be a Year 0 timestamp in UTC) that is out of range.  That value is still valid though for ANSI purposes (`0001-01-01 00:00:00.000000` to `9999-12-31 23:59:59.999999` is the valid range) and Spark is okay with those values.",
