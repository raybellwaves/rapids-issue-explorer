Some of the differences that we need to be able to handle are:\r\n\r\n- We sometimes need to support single-digit months and days, and sometimes we require two digits\r\n- We sometimes need to trim all leading and trailing whitespace, sometimes we only trim specific whitespace chars, sometimes we don't trim at all\r\n- Sometimes we perform a cast instead of a parse, and in that case we support special values \"epoch\", \"now\", \"today\", \"yesterday\", and \"tomorrow\" (definitely an edge case because it doesn't much sense to store relative terms like this in a json file)",
