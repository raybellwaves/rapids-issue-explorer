        "body": "If I understand this correctly, I don't think it makes sense to do this change unless we _really_ need any performance gain from it, as it would .  The original PR modified `Expression` and relies on a new method to be implemented by expressions.  Until Spark 3.3 is the minimum Spark spec we support, we cannot rely on `Expression` objects providing or having this method, because they will derive from Spark's `Expression` and old Spark versions don't have the required method definition.  We could override it in our `ShimExpression` wrappers, but this doesn't handle `Expression` objects coming from the original CPU plan.\r\n\r\nI think we would need to see a demonstrated need for this (i.e.: some performance metrics showing how much can be gained on real-world queries) before prioritizing this work.",
