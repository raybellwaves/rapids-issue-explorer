        "body": "This is very similar to https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/8831 we might also want to look into window dropping columns. I know that it can happen, especially if the column is just used to create the window and does not need to continue afterwards. I don't think window would be a performance improvement. We are not going to gather the data for window. But it would be a potential memory reduction by dropping the column slightly earlier. But maybe not that big of a win.\r\n\r\nThe only other operator I could think of that might drop a column after it is used and we could avoid a gather is hash aggregate, but that would require changes to CUDF, and I don't think it is that common of an operation.",
