        "body": "I did some profiling on a simple sort and it looks to be a very small win at best.  The sampling itself for this simple case was only about 2 ms out of 5 ms to do all of the sub-sampling for the task. Which was a single batch. So there is a lot of overhead there that we should also probably look into.  That said, the entire query run we over 60 seconds, and the sub-sampling portion of it, including generating the data, was only 100ms.  So if we are looking at a very small improvement at best.  This is probably a low priority at this time.",
