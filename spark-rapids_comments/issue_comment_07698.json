        "body": "@razajafri #7485 is fixed by https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/pull/13335. \r\n\r\nIt also helped to make the API safer and showed that there is a performance improvement over doing an if/else (20% to 40% better). So it makes me rethink this a bit, but I still don't like `bitwiseMergeAndSetValidity` as an API. \r\n\r\nIt it is confusing to use, especially compared to something like if/else. So as an implementation I think  https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/pull/13335 has addressed my concerns. And an API no it has not.",
