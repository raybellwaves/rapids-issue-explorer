        "body": "The plugin has `spark.rapids.memory.gpu.oomDumpDir` for unrecoverable GPU OOM, which is equivalent to calling `jmap -dump` on the process. I am not sure if that's the crash you are interested in or if there are others?\r\n\r\nWe log warn all the threads active on the semaphore (the stack traces) when there is a GPU OOM as well. If it's GPU OOM we have some things in place but could probably do more if needed.\r\n\r\nOn JVM crashes (say when there is a bug in the native side of things and there is a segfault) we normally get an hs_err file with native stack trace and JVM stack trace. This file can be pretty useful to figure out what the executor was doing. There is also `XX:OnError` to call some command and I see some documentation of folks using it to drop into gdb for example, so perhaps that could be a trigger for more sophisticated actions.\r\n\r\nIt mostly depends on what the nature of the crash is IMHO.",

        "body": "I think the goal with this is to make a big debug easy button for customers.  We have a lot of ways to dump debug information, but it is not controlled by a single config, and it is especially hard to do if we are in a distributed setup. Perhaps in some cases, like with YARN, we can just have some instructions on how to set specific things to make it simple to send us a crash report when we don't have direct access to a cluster.  But for other environments we might need to think more about how to make this super simple and as consistent as possible between different cluster types.",
