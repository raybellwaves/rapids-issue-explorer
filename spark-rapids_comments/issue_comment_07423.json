It appears that the Hive text reader on CDH behaves differently from Apache Spark, Databricks, etc.\r\n\r\n1. `simple_floats`/`decimal(10,3)`: On CDH, 3 rows are read differently from other distros, because CDH appears to be trimming the input strings. (Like `spark-rapids` used to.)\r\n2. `simple_floats`/`decimal(38,10)`: Same as above.\r\n3. `simple_ints`/`decimal(10,2-3)`: Again, input trimming.\r\n4. `timestamps`: Several discrepancies from other distros:\r\n   - Spaces are trimmed.\r\n   - The timestamp regex accepts incomplete timestamps, e.g. \r\n     - `2020-09-16`\r\n     - `2020-09-16 22:32`\r\n   - The timestamp regex accepts timestamps with `T` separating the date and timestamp. E.g.\r\n     - `2020-09-16T22:32`\r\n5. `dates`: 2 major differences:\r\n   - Spaces are trimmed.\r\n   - Timestamps with and without `T` in them are honoured.\r\n\r\nThis does appear to be a secret-sauce situation. We need a CDH-specific shim for this reader.",
