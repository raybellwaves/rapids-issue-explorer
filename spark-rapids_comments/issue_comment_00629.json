Like you said, the AWS blog post is for XGBoost GPU accelerated training on Spark 2.x EMR Cluster.   The EMR team has a recent release 6.1.0 including Spark 3.0. We are still working with EMR team to enable GPU Spark 3.0 feature which is mainly the Spark SQL ETL you are interested.  We updated this github site to a new site: https://github.com/mgzhao/spark-xgboost-examples with two branches:  spark-3 and spark-2.  The spark-3 branch does have ETL example code on databrick/standalone.   I am working on publishing a detailed standalone EC2 cluster guide for GPU Spark 3.0.  Once we have GPU Spark 3.0 fully supported on EMR,  we will update you here and also add all the ETL examples/guide on Github.     ",

        "body": "Hi,\nthanks a ton for responding back to me. To be honest enough what NVIDIA is\ntrying to do with SPARK and the rest of the concepts is truly re-building\nthe entire concept of data to value. You cannot imagine the number of half\nminded, brain dead, bespoke, and technically redundant solutions in the\nmarket which are trying to sell themselves off just trying to align\nengineering and data science efforts into a single view.\n\nNVIDIA did that with SPARK, and it will be great to start using that. It\nshould not take more than 8 to 10 hours of work to get an example up and\nready. And I will be eagerly looking ahead for the same.\n\nSPARK 3.x.x was released by Amazon EMR last week, and we should have been\nable to start using some of the most exciting and promising features of\nSPARK 3 by NVIDIA by now :)\n\nRegards,\nGourav Sengupta\n\n\nOn Tue, Sep 1, 2020 at 5:18 PM mgzhao <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n\n> @gourav-sg <https://github.com/gourav-sg>, thanks for reporting the issue\n> and review both the AWS blog and our github example code.
