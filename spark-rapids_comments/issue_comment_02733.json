So it depends on what operator you were trying to use that it was complaining about.  We should support most structs when reading from parquet (which is what delta table was using underneath), but 0.5 should have supported it as well.   Delta table does other things though as well so perhaps something is going on there.\r\n\r\nif you can share the actual output of the explain (--conf spark.rapids.sql.explain=NOT_ON_GPU  or ALL -> see https://nvidia.github.io/spark-rapids/docs/configs.html for more information on that) it may give me more context.
