        "body": "Thanks @raven-biscocho-HH for filing the issue.  Unfortunately performing RLIKE directly in the join kernel is not something we have plans to do.  Regular expressions are very complex operations, and combining them with the join kernel would be a very large footprint kernel that is unlikely to scale well due to such high occupancy.\r\n\r\nGiven this is an inner join, normally we try to support those still on the GPU by keeping the hash join portion as a join but the non-hash join condition (i.e.: the complex case when) as a post-filter.  However we currently do not support LIKE where the pattern to search for is not a scalar.  RAPIDS libcudf does support this, so it seems like something we could add.  If the join is highly explosive without the case when being evaluated, this may still not be performant.\r\n\r\nRLIKE is a different matter.  RAPIDS does not support regular expression searching where the search pattern is not a literal string (i.e.: is instead different for each row being searched).  Like the join kernel discussion above, it's highly unlikely RLIKE with a column instead of a literal as the search pattern, would be supported anytime soon.\r\n\r\nThe headline says RLIKE but I only see LIKE statements in the screenshots above.  If the query is only using LIKE and not RLIKE, there's a chance we could do some changes to make this join stay on the GPU by performing the complex case when. statement as a post-filter (with the assumption the inner join without the case when is not extremely explosive).",

It's essentially finishing the work from #65.  Need to add JNI bindings to libcudf's `like` functionality that takes a column of patterns instead of a scalar pattern, and then update the plugin's `GpuLike` expression to support a column as well as a literal for the pattern.\r\n\r\nThis would not support the like conditions directly in the join, but rather perform the join just on the column keys without the condition then post-filter the join result with the columnar-pattern LIKE expressions.  I'm assuming the join is not a nested loop join on this condition but a sort-merge-join where this is an additional condition beyond the normal equality check between other join key columns.  I cannot verify that from the truncated screenshot above, would be great to see the warning message from the driver log for that join exec to verify.",
