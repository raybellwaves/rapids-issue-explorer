We can create a struct to match what Spark has, most of which could be time interval types, but months gets to be a little bit harder to support. We would have to store it as an int\r\n\r\nINT32: months, DURATION_DAYS: days, DURATION_MICROSECONDS microseconds.\r\n\r\nAfter that it is mostly a question of how/where we can interpret these values, and months is not supported by a lot of cudf APIs because it is not the normal time interval. We would need some follow on work for various operators that could support this, and because most APIs use it for scalar operations we would need at least scalar support for structs.",
