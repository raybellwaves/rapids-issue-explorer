        "body": "@Feng-Jiang28 Thanks for submitting this. I put in some fixes into CUDF, but it still requires a small change to the plugin to help address it. I thought I had put up a PR for it. But I guess I forgot to. If you want to give it a try you just need to change\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/blob/c5da29d4576d91dd1cf24d00b38ea318c93fcec1/sql-plugin/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/rapids/GpuJsonToStructs.scala#L179\r\n\r\nSo it passes `numRows` as the last argument after `ds`.  This will let the CUDF code know that if it sees a situation where there were no columns could be returned (a limitation in the current CUDF JSON parser) that it can create null columns of for the schema passed in. If you do want to do it let me know, otherwise I'll try to get to it next week.",
