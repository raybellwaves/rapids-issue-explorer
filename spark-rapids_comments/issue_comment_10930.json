Sorry I didn't respond here sooner.\r\n\r\n> > `collect_limited_list(true, 0, 0, 2)`...\r\n>\r\n> Not sure if this is a udf or not?\r\n\r\nThis isn't a standard SQL window aggregation, as far as I know.  My guess is that this is a UDAF from [Apache Datafu](https://github.com/apache/datafu), per https://github.com/apache/datafu/pull/24.\r\n\r\nFrom poking around, it appears that `collect_limited_list(col, N)` functions like `collect_list(col)`, but limits the output list-row to a maximum of `N` elements.\r\n\r\nOn the face of it, I don't foresee this being difficult to implement. (It won't be deterministic.)  I would, however, need to peruse the detailed definition of the function's behaviour.",
