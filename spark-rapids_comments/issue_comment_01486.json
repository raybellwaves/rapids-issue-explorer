        "body": "RAPIDS needs some kind of a GPU to run on.  Cuda does have the ability to share GPUs between multiple processes, but context switching becomes a performance problem and generally it should be avoided. Most resource managers like kubernetes and YARN will hand out GPU resources, but not partial GPUs.\r\n\r\nhttps://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/manage-gpus/scheduling-gpus/\r\n\r\n> Each container can request one or more GPUs. It is not possible to request a fraction of a GPU.\r\n\r\nhttps://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r3.1.0/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/UsingGpus.html\r\n\r\nSpark does the same thing and will request/schedule whole GPUs for an executor, but will allow you to split up the whole GPU between tasks in the executor.\r\n\r\n> In our project, we build an outer search engine wrapper for spark which bind multi gpu devices to search large scale vectors\r\n\r\nI am still a little confused about what you want. Are you asking to have a single query in it that will use both your search engine code and the RAPIDs plugin at the same time?  Or are you asking for RAPIDs queries to co-exist in the same multi-tenant cluster as search engine queries?\r\n\r\nIf you are asking for the first one (search engine and RAPIDS in the same query), then it is a really hard problem because of resource scheduling, like you mentioned.  This is very similar to doing ML/DL training at the same time as using the RAPIDS plugin, and sadly we don't have a good solution for this yet, because the two really need to be able to coordinate with one another so that they can share the resources effeciently.",

RMM is not really designed for multi-GPU in a single process, so I don't know how well it will work. Be aware that a lot of the java RAPIDS code also assumes that there will be a single GPU and tries to set the GPU automatically to avoid issues around new threads being created and auto-initializing to GPU-0. If you really have to have support for multiple GPUs in a single process we can work with you to try and overcome some of those issues in RMM and the RAPIDS java API.",
