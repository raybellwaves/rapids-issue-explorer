I feel we could have caught this if the CI for x86/arm were similar (not to say that I shouldn't have manually tested it)\r\n\r\nWe are trying to add 24.02 arm sanity test (due to lack of resource we would only test IT against spark341 for arm), feel free to update https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/blob/branch-24.02/jenkins/spark-tests.sh#L250C1-L250C26 if need some extra stuff for arm shuffle one (like provide ENV to trigger special cases or configs in pipeline)",
