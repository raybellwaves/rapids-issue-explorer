I mean opt-out for when the user knows.\r\n\r\n> What does including it make not possible or much harder as offset adding more complexity to the build and possibly introduce errors in building/testing?\r\n\r\nI wish the user can skip this code altogether when the user knows it's not needed. I have no additional comments beyond making it more robust.  \r\n\r\n> if it has side affects we want to know about it. \r\n\r\nThis is covered by the default profiles where it's used. And again I just mis-wrote regarding opt-in vs opt-out\r\n\r\n> Yes it needs to be including in the build so might affect iteration a little bit but once its downloaded I can't believe that is very much time.\r\n\r\nAgree, although a secondary issue, but why deal with it when not absolutely necessary, and so easy to avoid.\r\n\r\n",
