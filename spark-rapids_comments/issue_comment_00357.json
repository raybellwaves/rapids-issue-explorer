Your intuition is correct on both counts.\r\n\r\nThe order of operations would be:\r\n- Input dataframe has an index column and all other columns collapsed into a struct `Struct<datetime, int, string, float, boolean>`.\r\n- We use `collect_list()` to collect the structs by the index which results in `List<Struct<datetime, int, string, float, boolean>>` per index\r\n- We then sort each list based on the datetime column in the Struct.",
