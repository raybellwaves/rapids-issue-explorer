        "body": "This could end up being kind of difficult because `M` in java changes based on the locale that is set. But looking at the code here it looks like that locale might be hardcoded to `Locale.US`, so we might be okay here. But we need to dig in deeply to all of the versions that we support to be sure that is correct. We also need to add in tests that set the JVM to a different local so we can be sure that we cover this and can detect if something goes wrong.",
