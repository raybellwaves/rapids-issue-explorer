Even if I have tried to move many pof Spark-Rapids's pom setttings to the simple project (such as scalatest configurations, etc.), it's still not reproducing the wrong value \"\".\r\n\r\nSo I have no clue what settings in Spark-Rapids leads to this wrong behaviour. Since this issue looks not very urgent, I'll first ignore the failed test case and unblock Nightly build\r\n",

What would be your prefered way out here?",
