        "body": "CSV parsing uses a different code path to our CAST logic and does not have special handling for things like ansi mode or timeParserPolicy. Also, parsing from all non-string types is disabled by default and the documentation points out the reasons for this.\r\n\r\nIf we did want to support ansi/legacy in CSV parsing than we could consider a different approach where we just read strings from the csv file and then wrap in a projection that casts columns from string to another type.",
