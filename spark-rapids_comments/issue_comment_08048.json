        "body": "> one of the biggest things for the delta_log json files is having a performant and accurate json parser\r\n\r\nAgreed.  Given the relatively small amount of data in each JSON file, we may need to look into coalescing files to get a bigger amount of data for the GPU to process per invocation.\r\n\r\nWe also probably need to cover the rest of the metadata query on the GPU.  Unless the JSON parser is _really_ fast compared to the CPU (unlikely unless there is a ton of JSON to process), there's immediately going to be a fallback to the CPU for the very next operation (e.g.: ObjectHashAggregate, MapPartitions, etc.) and that transition will likely kill the speed gains from the JSON parsing on the GPU.\r\n\r\nThere's also the possibility that the JSON parsing has been cached, and the metadata query will start with an ExstingRDD Scan, and that may be tricky to speed up given the initial CPU rows -> GPU columns conversion at the very start.",
