        "body": "Given that the approach in #7127 doesn't seem to improve performance at all (and generally performs quite poorly), I believe we should try another approach. What if we focus on the ProjectExec case, and split the ProjectExec into a GpuProjectExec (which runs expressions that can on GPU) and a regular ProjectExec (that runs expressions that only run on CPU)? We still put this approach behind a configuration option at first, because I also think there will be edge cases/scenarios where this approach doesn't work as well.  If this works, then we can pursue a similar approach with FilterExec.",
