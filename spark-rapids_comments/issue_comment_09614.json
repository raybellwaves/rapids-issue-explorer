I knew ECC errors are not the hard evidence for a bad GPU but at least it can provide some insights.\r\n\r\nI do not want to have a separate tool to diagnostic this because the cluster may not be active after the job completed/failed. Imagine if this is a one time Dataproc job or a Databricks job cluster. \r\n",
