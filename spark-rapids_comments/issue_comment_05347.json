Worried about a case where data was written out in a sorted order, and user query is assuming data read by a task will be read in a sorted order.  If we reorder the files then we'll come up with a different data order than the CPU would for the task, and I'm wondering if we could potentially break some expectations.",

Also if I remember correctly Spark was sorting the files in an odd way where it was grouping them by whole files as much as possible, but if they didn't fit then the bits and pieces were combined together in the end in a single task. So if a user is relying on this behavior they may be in for problems with Spark itself, if the files ever grow larger than a single split.",
