        "body": "This isn't a complete solution, but the allow list that's in delta_lake_write_test seems to be working pretty well in practice.  It has the drawback that it's allowing some nodes to be on the CPU that might also appear in the \"real\" query being executed that we would not want on the CPU.  Seems like we would want a way to identify and isolate one or more specific sub-queries we're checking for Delta Lake support rather than every query that happens to fly by.",
