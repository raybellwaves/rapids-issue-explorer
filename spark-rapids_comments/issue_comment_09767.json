From Issue #9778 , Jason pointed out: \r\n> On Databricks 13.3, nulls in the Pandas DataFrame (represented as NaNs) are being honored as nulls in the resulting Spark DataFrame when converting a Pandas DataFrame to a Spark DataFrame. Pandas thinks there are nulls in the data, and those nulls are propagating to the Spark DataFrame.\r\n>\r\n> fastparquet loads the NaNs properly, but then when converting the data to pandas, pandas thinks the NaN values are null. This, in turn, causes spark.createDataFrame to produce corresponding nulls. When comparing this to the GPU direct load of the data that contains NaNs (not nulls), the test fails. The problem is not in the way the GPU loads the data, it's the way the NaNs get converted into nulls due to sending the data through pandas before converting to a Spark DataFrame.\r\n\r\nBasically he is asking to fix the test case so NaNs do not become nulls when passing through Pandas.
