        "body": "Fixing this is relatively straightforward.  GPU write classes should *not* be columnar, but instead produce rows.  Most writes produce no output, and the ones that do only produce a single row, so this is not a performance problem.  That will eliminate the transition at the end of the plan, but then the transition moves above the write node since it is not columnar but the GPU exec child is.  To fix that, GPU write classes should also inherit from `ColumnarToRowTransition` so Spark knows not to inject an extra transition between a GPU write and its GPU exec child even though the GPU write does not produce columnar output.",
