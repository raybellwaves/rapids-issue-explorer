In terms of what I am finding in #9153, it seems 128MB is a better default per thread, so I'm going to PR that. That said, we need to work out if this is going to be a static amount dedicated for shuffle in #8900, or if we are going to allow the maxBytesInFlight to \"fluctuate\" as host memory usage is in demand.",
