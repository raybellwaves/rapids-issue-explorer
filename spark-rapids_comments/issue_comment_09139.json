        "body": "> We have code in SpillableColumnarBatch to grab the semaphore before reading the data back to the GPU. But that is not enough. It does not happen when we acquire a batch that did not spill.\r\n\r\nSo we have code that doesn't call `getColumnarBatch`? Because we make sure we get the semaphore even if the `RapidsBuffer` didn't spill.\r\nhttps://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/blob/branch-23.10/sql-plugin/src/main/scala/com/nvidia/spark/rapids/SpillableColumnarBatch.scala#L111\r\n\r\nNow `LazySpillableColumnarBatch` that one will definitely not get the semaphore, unless you made sure to call `allowSpilling`.\r\n\r\nThat said, it would be fairly easy to add a call to grab the semaphore during the retry, it seems like a good place to handle it for all callers.\r\n",
