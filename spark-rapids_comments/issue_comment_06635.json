We can call this a bug since we can get wrong results (compared to Spark's results) with `min` and `max` on floating point columns, but I don't know how to fix it because these `min` and `max` are from cudf JNI, not from our plugin code. If we are allowed to fix it there then that's great. Otherwise, we should document this clearly.",

There is a lot more of a framework around them, and for group by we need the results to appear on the correct lines afterwards.  If one operation is doing a hash based aggregation and the other is doing a sort based one it gets to be really complicated to make them all play nicely together.  If CUDF could provide a way to plug in our own aggregations to group by or window afterwards, then it would be very interesting.",
