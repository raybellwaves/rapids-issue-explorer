        "body": "Note that Apache Spark has the same issue with the `HashJoin` trait that provides the `join` method that is invoked on the executor side.\r\n\r\nMoving the `doJoin` code to a standalone object (and providing the missing method values as additional arguments to the method) resolves the issue, although this may not be the cleanest solution.  There are already a ton of arguments to the method as it is.",
