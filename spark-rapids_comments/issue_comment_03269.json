For left outer with build left, we track the gather maps on the left side, emitting output batches as normal, but after the right stream side finishes, we track which rows were never generated in the left gather maps and emit null-join entries for those.  For left semi with build left, we track the gather maps for the left side, emitting _nothing_ as we stream the right side, and only at the end we concatenate all gather maps, remove duplicates, and emit those rows.  For left anti with build left, we do the same as left semi with build left but instead emit the complement of rows.",
