        "body": "To be clear this only happens when you let Spark do schema discovery for CSV or JSON. For CSV it is at least sub-sampling the data, but for JSON it reads and parses all of the data to determine the schema. This is horribly slow in either case and is something that generally is avoided by anyone in production. If we are documenting this we should explain the situation that is happening and why we have not optimized this use case.",
