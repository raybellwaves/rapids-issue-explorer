        "body": "@res-life not sure why you're pointing to that issue, it's not clear how it is related.  There are many examples of GPU implementations of `RunnableCommand` where we are passing tests without being flagged as not on the GPU despite executing and returning rows as it should.  See GpuWriteIntoDelta, GpuMergeIntoCommand, etc.  Also note that GpuExecutedCommandExec explicitly states it implements GpuExec yet does not want to be columnar since runnable commands return rows.  I think we need to remove GpuRunnableCommand and implement things in terms of RunnableCommand since we want to return rows, not columnar batches, for these operations per the discussion above.",
