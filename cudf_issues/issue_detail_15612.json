    "body": "Users outside of Spark-RAPIDS still use the default, non-pooled, host memory resource and thus have the overhead of pinned memory allocations in `hostdevice_vector`, and any other places where pinned memory is used for faster data transfer.\r\n\r\nProposal: Default to a memory resource with a small pinned pool. When the pool is full, the resource should fall back to new pinned allocations to keep consistent with the old behavior when too much pinned memory is used.\r\n\r\nTo ensure we don't impact CPU performance, the default size of the pool can be a set percentage of the total system memory. Pinning a small minority of system memory (~5%) should not have a negative impact.\r\n\r\nInitially, only `hostdevice_vector` would use this resource but we can expand the pinned memory use in libcudf once a default pool resource is in place.\r\n\r\nDetails to consider:\r\nPool should probably be created on first use - avoids duplicated pool is users set the resource before the first use.\r\nSwitching the host resource should work at any point, even if we must have two pools at the same time.\r\nCan the default pool be safely destroyed? streams can't be destroyed on exit, not sure about `cudaFreeHost`\r\n",
