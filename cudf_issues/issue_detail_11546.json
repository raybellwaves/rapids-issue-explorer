    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nIt is important to ensure that all device memory allocated inside of cuDF functions is done through RMM. \r\n\r\nIt is easy to overlook this, e.g., by forgetting to pass the `rmm::exec_policy` to a Thrust algorithm that allocates temporary memory. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nIt would be fairly easy to add this to our CI testing by writing a LD_PRELOAD library that overloads `cudaMalloc` to throw an error if it is called more than once.\r\n\r\nThis would ensure that there is only a single `cudaMalloc` call for the pool allocation.\r\n\r\nThere are some things to be aware of with this solution:\r\n- We'd need to ensure the pool is sized such that it won't need to grow for the tests\r\n- It would assume we're using cudaMalloc as the upstream resource for the pool (and not cudaMallocManaged)\r\n",
