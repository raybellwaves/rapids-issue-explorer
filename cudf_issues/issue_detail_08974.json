    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nIn the Spark plugin we have a push to try and support as much of structs as we can.  Cudf supports sorting of nested structs (no lists just basic types and other structs).  It would really be great if we could support max and min aggregations on these as well. There are a lot of different types of max/min aggregations and if we cannot get them all at once we can take it a bit at a time too. We would like to be able to support this for.\r\n\r\n- [X] Sort-based group by aggregations\r\n- [ ] Hash-based group by aggregations\r\n- [X] Group by scans\r\n- [X] reductions\r\n- [X] scans\r\n- [X] window operations\r\n\r\nlike described in https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/8964 null child column values would come before non-null child column values.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nJust what I asked for min/max aggregations that can work on structs.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nI'm not sure there is an alternative that we can support.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAdd any other context, code examples, or references to existing implementations about the feature request here.\r\n",
