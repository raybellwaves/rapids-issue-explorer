    "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\nNew parquet code was added to support writing nested types.  This is great, but it broke the java build.  As a part of fixing the java build I found that the new code checks for `nullable` on all of the columns to see if it matches what was set when the writer was initially configured.  But Spark can tell that validity is not needed in some cases where cudf apparently cannot, and cudf will add in a validity column in some cases when it is not needed.  because `nullable` only checks to see if there is a column, and not if there are actually any nulls we can run into a situation where spark tells us that there will be no nulls, but cudf blows up because it thinks that there might be.\r\n",
