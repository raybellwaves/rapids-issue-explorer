    "body": "Now that `rmm::pool_memory_resource` does not by default use half of available memory for the initial pool size, cuDF has hard-coded 50% of free memory as the initial size to match previous behavior for benchmarks and tests. This should be configured globally somewhere.\r\n\r\n             I'm thinking about whether we should parse `percent_of_free_device_memory` from some env variable, instead of hard coding like this in many places. By doing so we can control the number we want at runtime.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @ttnghia in https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/pull/14741#discussion_r1448304244_\r\n            ",
