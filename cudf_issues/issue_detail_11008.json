    "body": "**PROBLEM DESCRIPTION**\r\n\r\ncudF doesn't support applymap or applying using defined functions to columns containing list as cell values. Also, cudf can not save to_csv when dataframe has list columns. Both of these are supported in Pandas. However, switching back and forth between pandas and cudf is time-consuming for huge amount of datas, and it will be great if we can bring more support for list column dataframe\r\n\r\n**SOLUTION**\r\nI want to apply user defined functions to cudF columns with lists. The functions are not simple function with one arguement but more complex operation. Moreover I want to save cudf dataframe to csv or hdf5 without switching to pandas for the same type of dataframe.\r\n\r\n**Alternatives**\r\nOne alternative is to switch to pandas which is not ideal as I want to do everything in GPU. Another alternate solution I tried is by loading the list columns into numpy array and then apply the user defined function and then write them back to the dataframe which is again time-consuming. It will be way easier if I can just apply the function to the column directly.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
