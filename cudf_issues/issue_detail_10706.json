    "body": "Currently the contents of cudautils.py can be grouped into three sets of functionality:\r\n1. The first set of 7 functions are all targeted at supporting `find_first` and `find_last`, which in turn are used respectively by the `find_first_value` and `find_last_value` methods of Column objects.\r\n2. The second set of functions 4 around window sizes are used by the rolling calculations in rolling.py.\r\n3. The third pair of 2 functions is used for UDF compilation.\r\n\r\nThe functions in group 3 are necessary but should probably be moved to `core/udf/utils.py`. The remaining functions should be possible to remove altogether, but they may require some additional functionality to be added to libcudf. For instance, `find_first_value` and `find_last_value` may be possible to implement using libcudf's `lower_bound` followed by an equality check, and similarly `find_last_value` could be replaced with `upper_bound`, accounting for all of group 1. For group 2 functions I am not certain if the necessary functionality exists in libcudf's roling aggregations, so we may need to do a little more engineering there first.",
