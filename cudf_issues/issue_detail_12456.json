    "body": "This is a follow-up task arising from @hyperbolic2346's review of #12425. #12425 moved the implementation of `jni_writer_data_sink` from `TableJni.cpp` to its own header, with no changes to its implementation.\r\n\r\nThe implementation of `jni_writer_data_sink` could use some streamlining:\r\n1. There is a lot of commonality in `device_write` and `host_write`. It would be good to move the common bit out to its own function.\r\n2. `rotate_buffer()` could stand to have a better name.\r\n3. `jni_writer_data_sink` should probably move to the `cudf::jni::io` namespace.\r\n4. If moved to the appropriate namespace, `jni_writer_data_sink` need no longer reference `jni_` in its name.\r\n5. `device_write_async()` might need implementing. It might simply be a matter of calling `device_write` via `std::async`. This is not currently exercised.",
