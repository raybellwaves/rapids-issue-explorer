As shown in the Nsight Systems screenshot, the decompress_page_data event consumes the most time in the read_chunk operation, taking 46.877ms and 41.987ms out of 123.117ms, respectively. I am trying to reduce this decompression time but have found limited material, documentation, or GitHub issues on the subject. Do you have any suggestions? I am also considering using stream technology to accelerate the process but am unsure where to begin. Attached is my code for your reference. Thank you.\r\n[parquet_chuncked.txt](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/files/14726563/parquet_chuncked.txt)\r\n",
