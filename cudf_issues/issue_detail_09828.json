Please describe.**\r\nDoctests (#9815) show the following doctest failing:\r\nhttps://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/blob/582cc6e466c7d941e1b34893fd56fbd42fe90d68/python/cudf/cudf/core/series.py#L1783-L1793\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nFrom a preliminary discussion with @vyasr, we probably want to deprecate and remove `as_mask` from the public API.\r\n\r\nIn the short term, I am removing the doctests for `Series.as_mask().to_host_array()` in #9815 (f881890a2da5e139358e3d2f531d663853b53748) because it's somewhat untestable and not helpful to demonstrate to users if we deprecate and remove the feature. It appears that the buffer has a size of 64 bytes. I assume that's the smallest allocation RMM can give, but that's not obvious to users who look at the output data of the doctest. Furthermore, the doctest shows uninitialized (garbage) data in the output of `to_host_array()` which is misleading.",
