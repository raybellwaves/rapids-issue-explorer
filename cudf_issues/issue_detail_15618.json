Please describe.**\r\nCurrently if one attempts to explicitly materialize a cupy array via cudf.RangeIndex, this error is thrown:\r\n```\r\n(Pdb) import cudf\r\n(Pdb) cp.asarray(cudf.RangeIndex(0, 100))\r\n*** TypeError: Implicit conversion to a host NumPy array via __array__ is not allowed, To explicitly construct a GPU matrix, consider using .to_cupy()\r\nTo explicitly construct a host matrix, consider using .to_numpy().\r\n```\r\n\r\nOffline discussion with @vyasr and @pentschev suggests that we should have this usage working transparently. The benefit of this is that `cp.asarray(obj)` would work for all cudf objects.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nThe most straight forward way is to enable `RangeIndex.__array__`, which is currently disabled. The rationale is that when `__array__` is invoked, the intention of converting to numpy array is clear. However, additional care should be taken when it's being invoked within a cuDF API. According to @vyasr , we should leverage the frame tracking tooling to check if the `__array__` interface is invoked internally in cuDF, or externally. If the former, we should raise an error and suggest that `to_cupy` method should be used. If the latter, the API should work, but maybe a warning can be thrown suggesting this is not as efficient as `to_cupy`.\r\n",
