    "body": "Hi. Pip installation on Google Colab with `!pip install cudf-cu11 --extra-index-url=https://pypi.ngc.nvidia.com` seems to work but results in missing functionality. For example, trying to compute column correlations in a dataframe with a `min_periods` argument specified raises `NotImplementedError: Unsupported argument 'min_periods'`. Other general functionality seems to be missing as well with various errors raised. Interestingly, everything seemed to be working yesterday. Any thoughts on what could be going on? Having a working pip installation on colab would be a game changer!",
