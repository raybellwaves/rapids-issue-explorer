    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nWe are currently putting manual `await sleep(0)` points into our cudf code to enable use of cudf alongside Python async code in web server scenarios. Otherwise, cudf hangs our web server when it is used for handling requests. This gets worse as tasks get bigger, complicates having mixed CPU/GPU tasks, and unnecessarily forces architectural decisions like carefully separating processes and 2-level scheduling. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nSupport for Python3's async/await constructor. Part of the Python 2 -> 3 shift is native support for `async`, especially for IO (e.g., when handling web requests) and compute (e.g., compression tasks).  \r\n\r\nEx:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@route(/cluster/big/dataset/<datasetid>, method=POST)\r\nasync def cluster_big_dataset(dataset_id):\r\n    \r\n    df = await cudf.read_parquet(f'/files/{dataset_id}.parquet')\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would be great universally, but there's probably a ~top 10 list for most slow in practice: to/from I/O, groupby & merge, ... .\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\n* Going via Dask also supports this, but with way more overhead and complexity. \r\n\r\n* We currently use multiple Python processes to help with SLAs, but it's clearly avoidable.",
