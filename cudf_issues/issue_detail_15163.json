    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nThere is currently no way to run cuDF operations in a stream-ordered manner. Since cuDF is deeply tied to the pandas API, there are also limits to how much stream-ordering may be exposed in the public API. pylibcudf has no such restrictions and should allow complete control over streams.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nlibcudf APIs are being incrementally modified to support stream-ordering. Once #13744 is complete, pylibcudf should expose the same functionality in its APIs.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nA clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n#13087 and #13509 are examples of where stream-ordered Python APIs could be useful.\r\n",
