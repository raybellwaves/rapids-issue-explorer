    "body": "In #15589, @betatim had difficulty finding the [`print_env.sh` script](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/blob/branch-24.06/print_env.sh) that is requested as a part of filing an issue.\r\n\r\n> Is there a way to provide the same information via something like `import cudf; cudf.print_env()`?\r\n\r\nThis is probably a viable alternative to the shell script we currently recommend. I think we could re-evaluate the contents of that script. The downside would be that users having installation troubles wouldn't be able to import the package to call such a function -- but the environment information might still be helpful for diagnosis.\r\n\r\nAlso, it seems to me that many users skip the step of reporting environment information, so either the `print_env.sh` script is hard to find or issue reporters don't think it is important.\r\n\r\nxref: https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/15589#issuecomment-2083061696",
