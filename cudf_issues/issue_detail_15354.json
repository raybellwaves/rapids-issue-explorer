    "body": "@gerashegalov had a comment in https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/pull/15351 that I thought would make sense as a follow on. Specifically, we'd like to make a utility available in the JNI code so that classes that need to invoke `onClosed` can do so with the same common code.\r\n\r\n              This is now inconsistent with (Host)ColumnVector. If we cannot consistently move eventHandler.onClosed into a finally please add a comment, but hopefully we can and it could be generalized via some utls withEventHandler(eventHandler) or base class implementation.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @gerashegalov in https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/pull/15351#discussion_r1532615825_\r\n            ",
