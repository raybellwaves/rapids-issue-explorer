    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n`cuco::static_map` is currently slower than cudf's internal unordered map. As part of a general move towards relying on cuCollections for data structures, however, we have made the replacement in #9666.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n`cuco::static_multimap` was optimized as part of its incorporation into cudf in #8934, but because of the current structure of cuCollections these optimizations have not been ported to `cuco::static_map`. While addressing https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuCollections/issues/110 we should profile and make sure that the resulting optimizations are sufficient to close the performance gap.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThe performance loss was deemed acceptable in order to progress faster towards #9695, which will rely on features that `cuco::static_map` offers that `cudf::concurrent_unordered_map` does not.\r\n",
