    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nThere are currently a number of libcudf functions that accept a std::string argument when they don't need to own the string but could simply use a view. Others take a const ref to a std::string, explicitly indicating that they don't require ownership. These include:\r\n- https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/blob/ce247961216dd70f389763dc086f137c11ad7346/cpp/include/cudf/aggregation.hpp#L559\r\n- https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/blob/ce247961216dd70f389763dc086f137c11ad7346/cpp/include/cudf/interop.hpp#L107\r\n- https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/blob/ce247961216dd70f389763dc086f137c11ad7346/cpp/include/cudf/io/types.hpp#L210 (multiple in this file)\r\n- https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/blob/ce247961216dd70f389763dc086f137c11ad7346/cpp/include/cudf/io/json.hpp#L386 (multiple in this file, and also all other I/O format files like csv.hpp)\r\n\r\nThere may be others as well.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nWe should do a thorough audit of std::string usage in libcudf to ensure that we are properly using std::string_view instead where appropriate.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nA subset of this request was originally documented in https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/14413, which indicates that some of these changes may be nontrivial to implement.\r\n",
