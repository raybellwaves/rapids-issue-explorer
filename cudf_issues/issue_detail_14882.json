    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nWe have already migrated to using [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) to replace flake8 and pyflakes. A previous barrier to using ruff's `isort` lint was lack of support for custom sections, [that is now supported](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#isort-sections). Similarly, `ruff format` (which produces effectively black-compatible formatting) is now in \"stable\" beta and very usable.\r\n\r\nWe should consider migrating the separate `isort` and `black` configs to use `ruff check --fix` and `ruff format` respectively.\r\n\r\nThe advantage here is that ruff is orders of magnitude faster than both isort and black. For those of us that use format-on-save this is a significant quality of life improvement (formatting a large python file when editing cudf can easily take a few seconds with black).\r\n\r\nWe would also reduce our tool configuration options.\r\n\r\nWe might also at the same time consider increasing the default line length from the current (somewhat miserly) 79 characters.",
