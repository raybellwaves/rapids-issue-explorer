    "body": "The `filters=` argument to the `read_parquet` and `read_orc` functions is misleading in its name. Because it filters by row _group_, rather than by row, I think we should rename it to `row_group_filters=`.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the description for this kwarg is complicated and laden with jargon. I think we should simplify and provide some examples that clarify the use of this keyword:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    If not None, specifies a filter predicate used to filter out row groups\r\n    using statistics stored for each row group as Parquet metadata. Row groups\r\n    that do not match the given filter predicate are not read. The\r\n    predicate is expressed in disjunctive normal form (DNF) like\r\n    `[[('x', '=', 0), ...], ...]`. DNF allows arbitrary boolean logical\r\n    combinations of single column predicates. The innermost tuples each\r\n    describe a single column predicate. The list of inner predicates is\r\n    interpreted as a conjunction (AND), forming a more selective and\r\n    multiple column predicate. Finally, the outermost list combines\r\n    these filters as a disjunction (OR). Predicates may also be passed\r\n    as a list of tuples. This form is interpreted as a single conjunction.\r\n    To express OR in predicates, one must use the (preferred) notation of\r\n    list of lists of tuples\r\n```\r\n",
