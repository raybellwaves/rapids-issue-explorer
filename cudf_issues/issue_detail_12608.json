    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nWhen https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/pull/11452 lands, we'll get JIT `Groupby.apply` for a subset of UDFs and importantly, dtypes. However over the summer we only got as far as writing overloads for `float64` and `int64` dtypes in the users source data. It'd be nice if we could support more dtypes, starting at least with the rest of the numeric types.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nExtend the existing `groupby.apply`, `engine='jit'` framework to support the following additional dtypes:\r\n- `float32`\r\n- `int32`\r\n- `int16`\r\n- `int8`\r\n- `uint64`\r\n- `uint32`\r\n- `uint16`\r\n- `uint8`\r\n- `bool`\r\n\r\nA lot of the machinery in the original PR is fairly general and should make adding many of these easy-  however there will undoubtedly be edge cases. As such it makes for a pretty good first issue for anyone jumping into the numba extension piece of the codebase.\r\n",
