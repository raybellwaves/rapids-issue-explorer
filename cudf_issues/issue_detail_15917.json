    "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\nThe JSON parser expects the size of input JSON buffer to be less than 2147483647 bytes. \r\n\r\nTwo potential solutions: \r\n1. Fail gracefully when the total source size is larger than 2.1GB and direct caller to pass source files in batches.\r\n2. Enable batched reading in `read_json` i.e. split the source files into smaller batches, parse and construct partial tables, and finally return the concatenated table. \r\n\r\nThe second solution proposed looks better since multi-source reading does not currently impose any restrictions on the number of files passed to the reader.",
