    "body": "Hi, \r\n\r\nI am currently doing some feature engineering on a timeseries. My index is a datetime and I want to apply a rolling window. \r\nFYI the pandas code is running. \r\n`df['feature'] = df['feature'].rolling(f'{120}s', center=True, min_periods=1).sum()`\r\n\r\nwhich leads to the following error: \r\n\r\n`NotImplementedError: center is not implemented for offset-based windows`\r\n\r\nbasically, I want to change to cudf for runtime optimization. As I have a datetime as an index, rolling operation with centring is much appreciated due to the fact of handling missing values, just shifting by timestamp is not trivial as discussed [here.](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/20012) \r\n\r\nI would appreciate if you could take a look. (Maybe it occurs due to some changes in the API interface)\r\n",
