[Here](https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/files/12812419/fastparquet_string.zip) is a zipped Parquet file that seems to be read differently in CUDF.\r\n\r\nFrom https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/9387:\r\n```\r\nGPU COLUMN LENGTH - NC: 0 DATA: DeviceMemoryBufferView{address=0x30a003400, length=20, id=-1} VAL: DeviceMemoryBufferView{address=0x30a001e00, length=64, id=-1}\r\nCOLUMN LENGTH - STRING\r\n0 \"all\" 616c6c\r\n1 \"the\" 746865\r\n2 \"leaves\" 6c65617665730000000000000000\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be good to check with the CUDF native Parquet reader, and compare against the results from  `parquet-mr`.",
