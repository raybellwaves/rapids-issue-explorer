For example, compiling on all 10 cores of my i9-7900X  @ 3.30GHz takes 11 minutes as reported by `time make -j`.\r\n\r\nCompiling with `-ftime-report` may be a good place to start to see where all the compilation time is being spent.\r\n\r\nThis is likely due to the large amount of template instantiation that is required for instantiating functions for all possible types. We should make sure that best practices are being followed in template instantiation such that a template for a given type is only having to be instantiated once via explicit instantiation.\r\n\r\nMuch of our code is implemented in headers, which causes it to be recompiled everywhere that header is included. Using pre-compiled headers may help: \r\nhttps://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Precompiled-Headers.html\r\nhttp://itscompiling.eu/2017/01/12/precompiled-headers-cpp-compilation/\r\n\r\nFurthermore, code should be scrubbed from excessive and unnecessary `#include`s. Compiling with `-MD` will show what files are being included \r\n\r\nHere's a Clang tool that ensures you only include the necessary headers: https://github.com/include-what-you-use/include-what-you-use\r\n\r\nHere's a Clang tool to profile time spent in template instantiation: https://github.com/mikael-s-persson/templight\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
