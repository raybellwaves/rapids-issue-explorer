    "body": "This is a follow-up item that arose from https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/pull/13727.\r\n\r\nIt turns out that `COUNT_ALL` and `COUNT_VALID` are not supported in `cudf::reduce()` as `reduce_aggregation`s.\r\n(This is likely because their values can trivially computed from the results of `column::size()` and `column::null_count()`.)\r\n\r\nHowever, this causes obfuscation in any code that attempts to dispatch reduce aggregations generically. E.g. [Here](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/pull/13727/files#diff-ee2fd30f5a96f800a146b5b8262244eeb73a7758834b6ff41f9b4343fe281c56R133).\r\n\r\nIt would be good to have `cudf::reduce()` support `COUNT_ALL` and `COUNT_VALID` natively, so as not to require special handling in the calling code.",
