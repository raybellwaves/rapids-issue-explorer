Please describe.**\r\nDuring https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/pull/13729 we were able to round out the 4 and 8 byte dtypes supported by the groupby JIT engine, however shorter types such as `int8` and `int16` couldn't be added due to the missing support for those types from certain `libcu++` features we rely on in the shim library. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nWe should provide block level implementations for these types in c++ that don't rely on the particular libcu++ features.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nWe could also wait for libcu++ to provide things like `atomic_ref` for shorter types. \r\n\r\ncc @bwyogatama @PointKernel \r\n",
