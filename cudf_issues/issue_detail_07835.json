Since cudf Scalar has a host-side and a device-side, which one `astype` should operate on and what is the expected behavior? In addition, device side scalar is not really operable since libcudf does not cast scalars types. How to resolve for the discrepancy?\r\n\r\ncc @kkraus14 @brandon-b-miller ",
