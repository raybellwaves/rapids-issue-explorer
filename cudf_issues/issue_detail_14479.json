    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\n\nHistorically (I think) certain features were available in libcudf before others. For example, while hash joins appeared quite early on `cudf::contains` was only factored out of the semi join infrastructure in #11100.\n\nAs a result, there are a number of places in cudf where an API was implemented using a sub-optimal approach (be that in terms of memory footprint or performance) just because it was needed in the Python API.\n\nFor example in #14478, we replace a sub-optimal (in both memory _and_ performance) inner join, with a call to `cudf::contains` now that it is available.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n\nWe should go through and check for other instances of this historical anti-pattern and either:\n\n- replace with calls to appropriate (existing) libcudf primitives\n- gather feature requests for new libcudf primitives based on the usage we observe.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\n\nn/a\n\n**Additional context**\n\nIt is probable that candidates can be found by looking calls to `merge` in the cudf codebase. As well as argsort/scatter/gather patterns (that's #13557).\n```[tasklist]\n### Tasks\n- [ ] https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/13557\n- [ ] https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/pull/14478\n- [ ] https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/14480\n- [ ] https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/14485\n- [ ] https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/14486\n- [ ] https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/13630\n- [ ] https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/13565\n- [ ] https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/13456\n- [ ] https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/14487\n```\n",
