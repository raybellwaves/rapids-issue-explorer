    "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\nWe currently make use of certain numpy and pandas utilities for dtype checking in various parts of our code base. These utilities are not reliable for us because they do not necessarily work on our extension dtypes, but currently these issues are being handled on a case-by-case basis, leaving us open to various bugs. We should instead write our own utilities that handle our own dtypes in addition to the common dtypes from other projects.\r\n\r\n**Steps/Code to reproduce bug**\r\nHere's one example for `np.issubdtype`.\r\n```\r\n>>> np.issubdtype(cudf.Decimal64Dtype(10, 2), np.int32)\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n  File \"/home/nfs/vyasr/local/rapids/compose/etc/conda/cuda_11.2.0/envs/rapids/lib/python3.7/site-packages/numpy/core/numerictypes.py\", line 419, in issubdtype\r\n    arg1 = dtype(arg1).type\r\nTypeError: Cannot interpret 'Decimal64Dtype(precision=10, scale=2)' as a data type\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nReturns True or False\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nHere's a not necessarily exhaustive list of functions that may need to be replaced (some have equivalents that simply aren't used everywhere):\r\n- [ ] `np.issubdtype`\r\n- [ ] `np.can_cast`\r\n- [ ] Anything from `pd.api.types`\r\n- [ ] `np.find_common_type`",
