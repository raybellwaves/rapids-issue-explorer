    "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nRelated to #15764\r\n\r\nChanging `uses_custom_row_groups` from hardcoded `true` to the below (correct) logic for `chunked_parquet_reader` tests from `ParquetChunkedReaderTest.TestChunkedReadWithListsNoNulls` start failing (see the log below). This happens if `uses_custom_row_groups = false` and eventually [ComputePageSizes](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/blob/branch-24.06/cpp/src/io/parquet/reader_impl_preprocess.cu#L1473) is not computed.\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nbool const uses_custom_row_bounds = options.get_num_rows().has_value() or options.get_skip_rows() != 0;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis has been done to avoid a couple other bugs as described by @nvdbaranec and @ttnghia:\r\n\r\n> We are calling `read_chunk_internal()` in a few places where we're only passing`read_mode`.  But if chunked_read_size is > 0 we need to force that to be true.   If we don't, various important things don't happen for all the remaining chunks. Basically if this code doesn't execute, it'll be bad\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/blob/bd7b5101cfb77b5b0210cc1d7b78a587821b9bf6/cpp/src/io/parquet/reader_preprocess.cu#L499\r\n\r\nTest fail
