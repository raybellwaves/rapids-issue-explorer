    "body": "As noted by [@harrism in #13577](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/pull/13577#discussion_r1230283942_).\r\n \r\n> I would agree with you @bdice  if `size_in_bits` took a size in bytes argument. But as it is, you have to write `data_buffer->size() * size_in_bits<std::byte>()`, which is kinda dumb.  `size_in_bits(data_buffer->size())` would be OK.  I think `* CHAR_BIT` is OK too.\r\n\r\nThis could be solved by removing the template argument from `size_in_bits` and just implementing it as a `constexpr` function that multiplies its argument by `CHAR_BIT`. All of the usages in `static_assert`s would still work (since the call would just change from `size_in_bits<T>()` to `size_in_bits(sizeof(T))`).",
