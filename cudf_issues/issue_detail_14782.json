    "body": "RMM has introduced a pinned host memory resource, and is in the process to make changes for the pool memory resource to be compatible (https://github.com/rapidsai/rmm/pull/1392).\r\n\r\nI have tested gutting `PinnedMemoryPool`, turning into a thin wrapper to a `pool_memory_resource<pinned_host_memory_resource>` in a draft PR, that uses some initial work that @jbrennan333 started. Here's what we have so far: https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/compare/branch-24.02...abellina:cudf:ab-pinned-pool.\r\n\r\nWe would like to make architecture decisions on how we could use the pinned pool, perhaps the single one created for the JNI side of things, to be shared with cuIO https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/14314.\r\n\r\nIt would be great or us to try and repro this https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/12341. And see if the new approach removes the slowness we have occasionally seen.\r\n",
