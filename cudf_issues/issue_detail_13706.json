I am opening this issue to be a tracker for the work we've deferred from other PRs.\r\n\r\n- Functions like `getblock32` can be reused by multiple hash functions. https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/pull/13612/files#r1265587501\r\nAlso consider optimizing this to use `memcpy` or `if constexpr` on key type perhaps.\r\n- Functions like `rotate_bits_left` should not use CUDA intrinsics (it doesn't affect the PTX/SASS compared to a naive shift-based implementation), thereby making them `constexpr`-friendly and possible to put into a shared `hpp` header. https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/pull/13681#discussion_r1264527017\r\n- The `@brief` of hashing APIs should mention the algorithm name. https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/pull/13612/files#r1267270076",
