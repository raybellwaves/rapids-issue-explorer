    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n`cudf.Series` does not have reverse binary operators for bitwise operators like `__rxor__`. This was caught after changing the output of `Series.hash_values` from a `cupy.array` to a `cudf.Series` in #9390, which broke NVTabular: https://github.com/NVIDIA-Merlin/NVTabular/pull/1376#pullrequestreview-868327738. The `cupy.array` class supports both directions, like `array ^ scalar` and `scalar ^ array`. Similarly, pandas supports both directions. Currently `cudf.Series` only supports `series ^ scalar`.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nAdd reverse binary operators for all cases that are missing, which include at least bitwise operators like `__rxor__` but possibly others as well. Missing operators have been addressed several times in the past (#208, #213, #1292, #8598, ...). Resolving this issue should involve checking the full list in the [Python object model documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__radd__) to make sure we catch everything that pandas supports.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nA workaround is to use the binary operator in the reverse order (for commutative operators).",
