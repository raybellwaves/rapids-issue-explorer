Dev containers have them enabled. \r\nin rapids-compose also, it's disabled by default in bash-utils.sh\r\n\r\nPR https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/pull/14771 fixes deprecated warnings introduced when https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/pull/14202 merged. These warnings didn't showup during development (used rapids-compose)\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\ndeprecated warnings should be enabled by default.\r\ndeprecated APIs usage are typically removed from unit tests, benchmarks and wrapper APIs as well.\r\n\r\n**Environment overview (please complete the following information)**\r\n - Environment location: Bare-metal, rapids-compose\r\n - Method of cuDF install: from source\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nhttps://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/pull/14771#issuecomment-1899129821\r\n",
