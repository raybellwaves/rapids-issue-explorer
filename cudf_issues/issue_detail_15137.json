We should test some of these out.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nFeatures to test:\r\n- [ ] Apply `cython.final` decorator to classes. This will reduce the overhead of `cpdef` methods by removing the need to look up child classes.\r\n- [ ] Use `cython.freelist` for objects that may be created and freed often. Good examples would be lightweight objects like `pylibcudf.aggregation.Aggregation`s\r\n- [ ] Add `not None` to parameters that must be provided so that they can be checked cheaply at runtime.",
