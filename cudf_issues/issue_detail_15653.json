    "body": "I would like to implement a function that can generate AST expressions, for example, by recursively converting a different expression class, such as an Apache Arrow `arrow::compute::expression` [object](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/main/cpp/src/arrow/compute/expression.h), to a `cudf::ast::expression` [object](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/blob/branch-24.06/cpp/include/cudf/ast/expressions.hpp). \r\n\r\nIs this even possible? libcudf's AST expression classes only accept references that are owned by the caller function; this is a problem since we can not recurse anymore. Is there any way to do this, to implement functions that can generate AST expressions instead of hardcoding expressions in a caller?\r\n\r\n",
