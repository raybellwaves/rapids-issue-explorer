    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nApache Spark optionally validates several things according to the JSON spec that the CUDF parser does not currently validate.  \r\n\r\nhttps://www.json.org/json-en.html\r\n\r\nThe reason this is a problem is that Spark will return a null for any JSON input that violates the spec. So if there is a row where part of it is not valid we need a way to make sure that we return a null for that.\r\n\r\nIdeally we want to do something like https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/pull/14996 which is a huge performance win for us, or ask for CUDF to return nested types as strings for us. If CUDF does not do the validation in those cases we will not even see that data and end up returning an incorrect value. But even without this there is some string validation that involves escape sequences and we cannot validate it ourselves because CUDF has already processed the escape sequences in many cases.\r\n\r\nThere are a few places where CUDF is not validating the JSON, and it appears to really be in values.\r\n\r\nAccording to the spec a value that is not a string, object, or array must be `true`, `false`, `null`, or a *number*. It appears that CUDF accepts most unquoted value as valid. Spaces in the middle of an entry appears to make it invalid.\r\n\r\nSpark does not have any configs to enable/disable this type of validation.\r\n\r\nAgain according to the spec a *number* should match the regular expression \"^-?(?:(?:[1-9][0-9]*)|0)(?:\\\\.[0-9]+)?(?:[eE][\\\\-\\\\+]?[0-9]+)?$\" \r\nSpark does have a few options related to numbers.  \r\n  1. They have an option to enable leading zeros, which changes the regular expression to look more like \"^-?[0-9]+(?:\\\\.[0-9]+)?(?:[eE][\\\\-\\\\+]?[0-9]+)?$\". This is not on by default so it is okay if CUDF does not try to support this, but I did want to call it out.\r\n  2. Spark also has an option to include `NaN`, \"+INF\", \"-INF\", \"+Infinity\", \"Infinity\", and \"-Infinity\". Sadly this is on by default. Not sure if we could just include an allow list similar to how CSV handles boolean values.\r\n \r\nAccording to the JSON spec a quoted string is allowed to only have a very small number of things that can be escaped with a backslash. `\"`, `\\`, `/`, `b`, `f`, `n`, `r`, `t`, and `u` followed by 4 hex digits.  Spark has a config to disable this and allows escaping of any character, including `\\u` without the hex digits. As this is enabled by default in Spark we are fine if this check is not implemented, but I wanted to document it.\r\n\r\nThe JSON Spec also says that a quoted string cannot have \"control character\" in it. Here a control character appears to be anything between `\\u0000` and `\\u001f` inclusive. Spark does enforce this by default, but it varies by the JSON command used, like `get_json_object` has the check disabled. This is something that we eventually will need support for.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI would like a few configs for the JSON reader that would let us pass in options to enable/disable validation based on things similar to what Spark does today.\r\n\r\nWe already support this more, or less for single quoted strings, and it would be great to extend it to include validation of numbers with/without leading zeros, and with/without an allow list of special cases; and validation of unescaped control characters.",
