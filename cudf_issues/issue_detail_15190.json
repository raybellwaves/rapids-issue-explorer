Please describe.**\r\n\r\nAs we build out the pylibcudf API, having type stubs for lsp and type-checking integration becomes increasingly useful.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nProvide type stubs (with docstrings) so that lsp/type-checker integration works.\r\n\r\nWe don't want to replicate docstrings in more than one place, I don't know if the right place for them is the type stub file.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nHaving the relevant pyx file open in an editor at the same time.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nThere are a number of half-working auto-generation engines for stubs, but none of them seem to work that well, so we should probably just do this by hand.\r\n",
