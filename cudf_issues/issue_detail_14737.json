    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nlibcudf's public API currently includes use of Thrust types like `thrust::device_vector`. This means libcudf implicitly depends on the ABI of those Thrust types to be stable not only across Thrust versions, but even within the same version (e.g., host TUs vs device TUs).\r\n\r\nThis is problematic because [Thrust and CUB symbols make no ABI stability guarantees](https://github.com/nvidia/cccl?tab=readme-ov-file#application-binary-interface-abi). \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nThrust types in libcudf's public API should be replaced with types that have ABI guarantees. This likely means replacing with equivalent `cuda::std::` types. \r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nThis is related to https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/14734 in a roundabout way that isn't worth going into the details. \r\n\r\nSee also:\r\nhttps://github.com/NVIDIA/cccl/issues/1246\r\nhttps://github.com/NVIDIA/cccl/issues/1262\r\n",
