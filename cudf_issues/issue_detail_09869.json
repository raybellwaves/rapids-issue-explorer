This would be a whole lot neater if `cudf::nullate` were used instead.\r\n\r\nThis would require `cudf::make_pair_rep_iterator` to support `nullate` first, which obfuscates the already drawn out change in #9510. The proposed switch to `cudf::nullate` will ideally be a focused change, handled separately.",
