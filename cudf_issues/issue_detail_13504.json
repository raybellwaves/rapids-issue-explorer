    "body": "**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI'd like to (in 2 separate PRs)\r\n~1. Replace .md issue templates with .yml forms~\r\n   - ~With these templates I'd remove the https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/labels/%3F%20-%20Needs%20Triage label from always being on new issues~\r\n2.  Use a GitHub Action to automatically label and reply to issues filed by people outside of RAPIDS\r\n    - Goal: reduce the noise of the https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/labels/%3F%20-%20Needs%20Triage label and ensure we respond quickly to external filers\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nWe could also do triage rotations with the GHA but I prefer the auto-labeling and leveraging the label to track as needed.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nWe do this in Morpheus - references: \r\n- [Form template issues](https://github.com/nv-morpheus/Morpheus/issues/new/choose)\r\n- [Auto Labeler](https://github.com/nv-morpheus/Morpheus/blob/branch-23.07/.github/workflows/label-external-issues.yml)\r\n\r\nLooking to solicit feedback prior to making any changes. If feedback is all \ud83d\udfe2 then I'll PR these changes in ASAP and we can work through the specific implementations in the PR review.\r\n",
