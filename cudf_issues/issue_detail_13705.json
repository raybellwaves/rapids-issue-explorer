    "body": "Currently, cudf hashes decimals the same way regardless of their scale. To me, this is a violation of \"different values hash differently\". The scale is a piece of column metadata but I think it's relevant to the hash computation because hashes are typically used as a proxy for equivalent representations. I think this could be considered a bug. My proposal would be to combine the column scale into the hash of the value.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @bdice in https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/pull/13612#discussion_r1264530164_\r\n            ",
