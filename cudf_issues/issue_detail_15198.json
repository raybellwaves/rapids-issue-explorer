    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nCurrently some pylibcudf APIs have default values for parameters while others do not. Defaults are a double-edged sword because while they are convenient, the underlying libcudf APIs also have defaults and the two could diverge.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\npylibcudf APIs should decide whether they offer defaults. The two options would be to either offer no defaults and require users to provide all parameters, or offer the same defaults as libcudf, in which case it would be the responsibility of pylibcudf devs to keep those defaults in sync with libcudf. \r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nThere isn't really any cost to the defaults in pylibcudf diverging from those in libcudf, so as long as they're documented it might be fine to have defaults for user convenience and not be overly concerned about ensuring that they remain identical to libcudf's in perpetuity.",
