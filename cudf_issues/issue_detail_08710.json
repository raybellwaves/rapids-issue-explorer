    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nAs a part of #8440 it was decided that for running window aggregations that scan and group by scan should be used. COUNT_ALL is supported on group by scan, but not by scan itself.  COUNT_VALID is not supported by either.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nIt would be nice to have these supported.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nRight now I have put together a solution that uses SUM, is_null, and copy_if_else to replicate COUNT_VALID, and COUNT_ALL.  This is not ideal and I would like to move away from it.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThis is not super critical because I have a working solution, but it would improve performance and reduce memory usage.\r\n",
