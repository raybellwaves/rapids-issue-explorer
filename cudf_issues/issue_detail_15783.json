The `codecov/patch` custom github action doesn't always seem to be posted on the PR. Last PR that had this posted on was: https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/pull/15719\r\n<img width=\"851\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-05-20 at 6 53 12\u202fAM\" src=\"https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/assets/11664259/6173fc79-3b1f-434e-9d94-d33a12aa79fb\">\r\n\r\n2. `codecov` bot seems to have stopped commenting on PRs the diff coverage as it used to:\r\n<img width=\"1197\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-05-20 at 6 54 30\u202fAM\" src=\"https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/assets/11664259/978a924a-96be-42a4-b214-bd0088dcf9af\">\r\n\r\n3. The base branch coverage is off by a few lines always because we generate the coverage by running the tests nightly are there any best practices and recommendations from `codecov` team on how to have a very upto-date base branch coverage?\r\n\r\n",
