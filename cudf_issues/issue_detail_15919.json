    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nCurrently cudf supports reading files from remote sources by reusing the arrow NativeFile interface. Such files can be passed down from Python into libcudf and configured to only read the selected subset of data from the remote resource. This can be vital for the performance of some workflows. However, as part of #15193 we will be removing libarrow as a dependency of cudf and libcudf. This means that we will no longer be able to rely on the NativeFile interface. This is a breaking change for the cudf and libcudf APIs, as well as being a performance hit for some workflows.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nWe need to evaluate alternatives that will allow us to maintain or improve upon performance for remote I/O while not depending on libarrow. The arrow removal has numerous ancillary benefits and will be moving forward, so we need to find a way to mitigate that. Ideally we would also want to get a sense of how much the NativeFile-based interfaces are currently used.",
