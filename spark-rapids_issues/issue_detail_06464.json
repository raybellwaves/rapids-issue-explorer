If there is please let me know how.\r\n\r\nThese are the requirements:\r\n\r\n1) Easily allow developer and jenkins to run the tests in a reproducible manner on a CDH cluster.\r\n2) have an option for the production jenkins IT job to leave the workspace around to be able to easily reproduce the failure.\r\n\r\nThe idea is if we see a failure, we could rekick jenkins with an option to leave the workspace around. The developer can ssh to the cluster go to a single directly and run a single command (or very few) to run the tests and reproduce the failure.",
