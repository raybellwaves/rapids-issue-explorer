Please describe.**\r\nSpark 3.1.x supports constants such as `now` and `today` in JSON to represent timestamps and we do not support this on the GPU.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nIt seems unlikely that this is a priority for us, but just filing this issue so I can link to it from the xfailed tests. We could add some regex to support this if needed.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\n",
