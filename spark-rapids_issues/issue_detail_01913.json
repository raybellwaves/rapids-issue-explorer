    "body": "As a part of #1910 a number of bugs were found in the murmur3 code because it was not thoroughly tested. It missed problems with the byte, short, float, and double types that were easily caught as a part of testing in the python integration tests by simply testing those types.\r\n\r\nThis is to add in tests to the integration tests that will explicitly test the `hash` function.  We should remove the test from UnaryOpsSuite because `hash` is not a unary op and it is not doing a very complete job of testing `hash`.  The new test should remove the explicit calls to hash in `test_hash_repartition_exact`.  The new tests should cover all of the data types supported by `hash`, it should include literal values, and a wide combination of the types and the order of the types passed into it.",
