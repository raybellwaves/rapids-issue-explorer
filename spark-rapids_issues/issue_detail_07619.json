    "body": "#7502 added `GpuRunnableCommand` to add a columnar form of returning results, but the bulk of the data for the command does _not_ flow through the result of `run` or `runColumnar`.  We already have many examples of things that implement GPU versions of `RunnableCommand` without needing `GpuRunnableCommand`, and it actually makes the execution _slower_ in practice if it were forced to be columnar since the things returning a non-empty Sequence of items usually are returning high-level metrics or other things gathered on the CPU, not produced by the GPU.",
