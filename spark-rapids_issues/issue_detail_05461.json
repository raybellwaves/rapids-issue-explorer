    "body": "Typically with Spark we look at the physical plan and decide what should run on the GPU and what should not based only on that plan. But there are some things that we cannot detect until we start to look at the file itself. These could be things like encryption, or some types of schema evolution in ORC.\r\n\r\nWe should provide a way so that if we hit a situation at runtime that we cannot handle instead of crashing we should be able to read the data using the CPU, ideally using the exact same code that Spark would have used, and then transition it to the GPU.  This might happen on a per-file basis, so it would not even be per-task.",
