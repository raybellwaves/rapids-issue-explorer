This changes the API for BaseArrowPythonRunner\r\n\r\nwe have our own GpuArrowPythonRunner but it doesn't seem to have the same pythonMetrics.  But there is a bigger change for python data source that may have introduced some of it - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-44076\r\n\r\nSo just filing this to double check and see if we should be using this.\r\n",
