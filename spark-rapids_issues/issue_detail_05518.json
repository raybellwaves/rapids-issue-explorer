Please describe.**\r\nIn the below PR's they have replaced all invokes of `sys.error()` by throwing of `IllegalStateException` in the `sql` namespace.\r\nWe have copied some of the copied code where we invoke `sys.error()` . We should also remove these to keep the code in sync with Spark code. I don't think it's a priority but filed this for tracking.\r\n\r\nSpark commit - https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/c2bd7bac76\r\nFollow on - https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/1372f31205",
