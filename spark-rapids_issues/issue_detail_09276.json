    "body": "Usually we can infer the Delta Lake version being used by examining the Spark version, but the mapping from Spark version to Delta Lake minor version is not always 1-to-1.  Spark 3.3.x has multiple Delta Lake versions that are supported, for example.\r\n\r\nSometimes the minor version of Delta Lake adds a new feature that needs to be tested in a pyspark integration test, but currently there's no way to tell from within the integration test code which version of Delta Lake has been configured for the test run.  We should consider adding a pytest flag, e.g.: --delta_lake_version, that conveys to the integration test environment what version of Delta Lake has been configured.  Alternatively we could modify the existing --delta_lake flag to take a version argument.\r\n",
