    "body": "As seen in #4207, sometimes the RAPIDS Accelerator does not always throw the same exception type that Apache Spark would throw in the same situation.  For example, recent Spark versions now have custom Spark exceptions such as `org.apache.spark.SparkArithmeticException` while the plugin will typically throw `java.lang.ArithmeticException` instead.  There are probably other instances where the exception types do not always line up, especially with the recent refactoring and consolidation of exception code in Apache Spark.",
