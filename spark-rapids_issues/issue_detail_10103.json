But it would be great if we could find a way to unify all of these into a single log along with messages about exactly which buffers are being spilled, which ones are being read back in. How long it takes to do these operations/etc.\r\n\r\nthis would be off by default and enabled with a config so performance would not be absolutely critical here.",
