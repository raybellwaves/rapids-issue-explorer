They may not all show up at once, so we might need to work on it a bit at a time to really get it to work.\r\n\r\nFor the running window optimization we are also going to need https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/8964 and we might also need support for replace_nulls and group_by replace_nulls. I have not tested if those work with nested types or not.  If they do not, this is just a memory/performance optimization, so it is not critical to get it done on the first go.",
