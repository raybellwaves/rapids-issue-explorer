Please describe.**\r\n\r\nI recently ran some tests reading JSON on GPU with Spark 3.2.1 and I saw the following warning but the query did run on GPU anyway. It would be good to at least document this but even better if we can avoid the warning.\r\n\r\n```\r\n!Exec <FileSourceScanExec> cannot run on GPU because unsupported file format: org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.text.TextFileFormat\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nSuppress the warning or document it.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nNone\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nNone\r\n",
