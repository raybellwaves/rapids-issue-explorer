But if one of the shim versions fails, then we stop and don't deploy the final rapids plugin jar.  This means the artifacts deployed are mismatched because the latest rapids plugin jar is older than the integration tests jar.  Our IT builds now check for mismatch and fail.\r\n\r\nTo prevent this, perhaps we can wait and deploy all files after building everything.",
