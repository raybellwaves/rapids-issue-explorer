    "body": "As @revans2 mentions here https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/pull/6810#discussion_r996044048, the python worker interaction with the `GpuSemaphore` is a bit more complicated than 1 thread per task. I am filing this to investigate this edge case. Ideally if we have a job that is using this python interface we should be able to dump the java stack traces where we last  saw these threads.\r\n\r\nNote there is a `PythonWorkerSemaphore` and it would be great to understand if there are ways to reuse the `GpuSemaphore` for some of this in the future. I think (though I am not sure) that if all threads are using one semaphore it would simplify things, though I bet the code isn't setup for it now (e.g. as the `PythonWorkerSemaphore` says, the main semaphore is initializing the GPU, but the python semaphore does not want to do that, because the python process will initialize access).\r\n\r\n@firestarman fyi.",
