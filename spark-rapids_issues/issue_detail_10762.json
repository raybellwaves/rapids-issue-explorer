Spark will prevent constant folding in subqueries that contain a COUNT-bug succeptible aggregate.  There is a new configuration flag `spark.sql.optimizer.decorrelateSubqueryPreventConstantHoldingForCountBug.enabled`  that is defaulted to `true`. We should ensure that our behavior is consistent with the fix that is now the default behavior.\r\n\r\nWe could fallback to GPU when the flag is set to false, but that logic is complicated since it's only COUNT in subqueries.",
