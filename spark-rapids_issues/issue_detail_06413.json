    "body": "While working on #6410 I noticed that `checkSchemaCompat` will often blindly assume that if the Spark type is a nested type then the corresponding Parquet `Type` must be a grouping type.  The point of this function is to check if the schemas are compatible, so it is not safe to make that assumption.  The code should have checks for a grouping type before calling `asGroupType`, and if the Parquet type is not a group as expected then the error callback should be used.",
