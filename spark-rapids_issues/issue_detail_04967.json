    "body": "nvcomp has made some really great progress, and it would be great if we could find a way to replace the shuffle compression/serialization with something more GPU optimized. In many cases having the CPU do the compression frees up the GPU to do more processing, but in other cases it would be nice to have the GPU do everything because the CPU is not able to keep up with the GPU.  This is especially true if the GPU semaphore is being held.  Not sure if there is something we could do with nvcomp to get a version of their compression that also runs well on the CPU too. Then it is something we could opportunistically do.",
