Please describe.**\r\nIn https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/pull/8243 we ran into a problem when attempting to spill a columnar batch where the underlying GpuColumnVector had a cuDF type of `DType.TIMESTAMP_MILLISECONDS` because there is no corresponding Spark type. Spark `TimestampType` represents cuDF's `DType.TIMESTAMP_MICROSECONDS`.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nIf we had a `SpillableTable` then we would not need to attempt to have a `SpillableBatch` in this case.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\n",
