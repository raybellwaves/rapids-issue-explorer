Please describe.**\r\n#6834 is intended to see that we can extract data from a timestamp properly. #6836 is so that we can parse the value correctly.

We should support these too.\r\n\r\n* [ ] GpuDateFormatClass\r\n* [ ] GpuUnixTimestamp\r\n* [ ] GpuUnixTimestampImproved\r\n* [ ] GpuToUnixTimestamp\r\n* [ ] GpuGetTimestamp\r\n* [ ] GpuFromUnixTime\r\n",
