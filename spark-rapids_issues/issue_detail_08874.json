We have put some pools in place with the idea that a user wouldn\u2019t really need to go beyond that, but in practice it can happen and then YARN, Kubernetes, docker, etc kills the executors because they tried to use more memory than the container is configured to use.\r\n\r\nThis epic is to put in place all of the changes needed so we effectively have a hard limit on the amount of host memory that the plugin uses and that amount is easy to configure.\r\n\r\nFramework Changes:\r\n  * [X] https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/pull/8857 This is to make things simpler to work with and reason about.\r\n  * [x] https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/8875\r\n  * [x] https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/8876\r\n  * [x] https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/8877\r\n  * [x] https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/8884\r\n  * [x] https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/8885\r\n  * [x] https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/8882\r\n  * [x] https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/8879\r\n  * [x] https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/8881\r\n  * [x] https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/8880\r\n  * [ ] https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/9862\r\n  * [ ] https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/8883\r\n  * [ ] https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/8878\r\n  * [ ] https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/9107\r\n  * [ ] https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/9965\r\n  \r\nOperator Changes:\r\n  * [ ] https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/8886\r\n  * [ ] https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/8887\r\n  * [ ] https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/8888\r\n  * [ ] https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/8889\r\n  * [ ] https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/8890\r\n  * [ ] https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/8891\r\n  * [ ] https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/8898\r\n  * [ ] https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/8899\r\n  * [ ] https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/8900\r\n  * [ ] https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/8901\r\n  * [ ] https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/8903\r\n  * [ ] https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/8904\r\n  * [ ] https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids-jni/issues/1570\r\n\r\nDebugability: \r\n* [ ] https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/10102\r\n* [ ] https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/10103",
