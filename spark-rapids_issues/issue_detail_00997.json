    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nWe're interested in data mining spark event logs for benchmarking purposes. But the GPU name is not exposed so it's difficult to determine what hardware is present. Our parser reads the top 4 rows and the last row of the event log file to obtain relevant fields related to configurations and total run time.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nIt would be great if something like \"spark.gpu.\" can be added (with attributes like name, memory, cores, cudaVersion, etc.) under \"Event: SparkListenerEnvironmentUpdate\" >> \"Spark Properties\": \r\n`\"Spark Properties\":{\"spark.gpu.driver.name\":\"Tesla T4\", \"spark.gpu.driver.memory\":\"16g\",  \"spark.gpu.driver.driverVersion\": \"450.11\", \"spark.gpu.driver.cudaVersion\":\"11.0\",\"spark.gpu.driver.cores\":\"2560\", \"spark.gpu.executor.name\":\"Tesla V100\", \"spark.gpu.executor.memory\":\"16g\", \"spark.gpu.executor.driverVersion\": \"450.11\", \"spark.gpu.executor.cudaVersion\":\"11.0\",\"spark.gpu.executor.cores\":\"5120\"}`\r\n\r\nThe driver GPU may be different than the executors, or perhaps no GPU at all.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nOne workaround would be to pass strings through the \"App Name\" field to be parsed in post processing, but it would require code modifications so it wouldn't be applicable on generic workloads. \r\n\r\n",
