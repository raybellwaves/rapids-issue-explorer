We document that you need to have Spark 3 installed.  It might be nice for us to have a tools jar that bundles Spark with it so user doesn't have to explicitly download Spark 3 separately.  For things like the user tools package we would want to shade Spark if possible in case they actually ran the qualification tool using Spark 2 spark-submit.",
