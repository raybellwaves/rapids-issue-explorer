The ones remaining are:\r\n\r\n- [ ] FullOuter\r\n- [ ] LeftOuter with BuildLeft\r\n- [ ] LeftSemi with BuildLeft\r\n- [ ] LeftAnti with BuildLeft\r\n- [ ] RightOuter with BuildRight\r\n\r\nSupporting these types of joins requires tracking the rows in the build table that match for each streaming batch and then performing a post-processing step based on either the rows that matched or the complement (i.e.: unmatched rows).  For example, FullOuter requires emitting all unmatched rows with null rows for the stream batch, and LeftSemi requires emitting only the rows that matched after all stream batches have been seen.\r\n",
