This is not captured in event_logs and even if they are, they are not logged in a format the devs are used to seeing on their console. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nLog the console output to a log file\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nI have tried looking at driver eventlogs but the output doesn't exactly match the console output and we need additional tools to make the data consumable by humans.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThis is step might be useful in documenting all the execs/expressions that are used in our test pipeline on a nightly basis.
