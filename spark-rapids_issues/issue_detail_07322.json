    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nwith https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/7219 I added a feature so that the multithreaded reader didn't need to keep the same file read order as Spark. In the PR for that it is just behind a config that defaults to True - spark.rapids.sql.format.parquet.multithreaded.read.keepOrder and to get it user has to specifically set it to False.\r\n\r\nI tried to have this defaulted to false and only change it to true when we found a query that might require the order to be the same. Specifically when no shuffles were found.   However the way I did it didn't work with dpp and reuse exchange because of subqueryBroadcast.  That passes in the plan where it doesn't show the shuffle, but later gets combined into a plan that has a shuffle. This made the setting different so we couldn't reuse the exchange. ",
