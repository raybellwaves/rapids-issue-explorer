Other operations like equals, join, less than, etc do not need to do these types of operations and should just work for any timezone. This should also be true for reading and writing parquet and for the most part ORC.  We should add in a few tests that verify that we can still process data correctly in other time zones that don't manipulate the timestamp/date itself.",
