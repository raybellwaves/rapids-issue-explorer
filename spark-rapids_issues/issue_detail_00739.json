    "body": "When we open a local shuffle block, or a remote block, there may be certain issues like length mismatch, format changes (say that one version of cudf contiguously slices one way, but the next version slices differently), compression issues, etc. \r\n\r\nThere are a number of these, and spark will throw `FetchFailedException` when:\r\n\r\n1. Zero-sized blocks\r\n2. Failure to open a local block\r\n3. Buffer format is corrupted (can\u2019t be decompressed for example), or the buffer can't otherwise be read.\r\n\r\nMost of these cases are relevant, to the rapids shuffle case. I think we can add handling for zero-sized blocks that shouldn't be zero-sized (metadata isn't a row count only), when we try to open a block locally and the block isn't there (bug likely), and when a buffer is corrupted due to compression.\r\n\r\nThe compression handling is harder since we uncompress later on (outside of shuffle). So it may be that we handle this one differently, and just make sure that the buffer fits the metadata spec, with whatever tools we have.",
