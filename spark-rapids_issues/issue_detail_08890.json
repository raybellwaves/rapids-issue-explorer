Please describe.**\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/9862 should give us a limit on the amount of host memory being used, but if it fails we want to be able to retry the allocations.\r\n\r\nFor Parquet, Orc and Avro reads we have a number of different options that can use a thread pool, and of the options that do not use the pool, we often want to share code with a version that does use a thread pool.  With the retry code this should not need to change, but we need to make sure that we \r\n\r\n1) add retry as needed around the host memory allocations, or blocks of code that allocate host memory.\r\n2) Update the thread pools, and any interactions we do with the thread pools so RmmSpark can keep track of potentially stuck threads.\r\n3) test all of the different threading options. That is probably already being done, but more stress testing would be good for this in particular.",
