It would be really interesting to see what the impact to performance would be if we could tell that the processing was currently in a retry block and instead of spilling to disk we threw a retry exception instead.\r\n\r\nThis would require a lot of rework for both the spill code and for the state machine, but it might have a big performance impact on jobs that need a lot of memory.",
