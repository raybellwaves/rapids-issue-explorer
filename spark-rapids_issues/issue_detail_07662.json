    "body": "In integration tests that specify a partition predicate, one sees that unless the operators used in the predicate are white-listed, the test fails, pointing at the partition predicates.\r\nE.g. Consider this read on a table partitioned by the `type` column:\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT * FROM mytable WHERE type = 'ELECTRIC' OR type = 'HYBRID';\r\n```\r\nThis fails with:\r\n```\r\njava.lang.IllegalArgumentException: The expression ((type#144 = ELECTRIC) OR (type#144 = HYBRID)) is not columnar class org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.Or\r\n```\r\nThe flagged expressions run on the metastore, not per row. As such, these cannot be GPU accelerated.\r\n\r\nPer @jlowe (on [#7653](https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/pull/7653#discussion_r1096162756)), this indicates that a `GpuExec` hasn't correctly overridden `gpuExpressions`, to filter out partition predicates.",
