While this works its not technically correct since its missing the other modules docs and source.  \r\n\r\nFiling to see if we want to discuss to do this differently.  normally you would distribute all the individual versions but I don't think we necessarily want to do that.  We don't really have any API either so the javadoc doesn't matter to much at this point.",
