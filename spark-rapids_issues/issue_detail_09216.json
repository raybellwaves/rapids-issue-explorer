Just because if a thread marks something as spillable it means that there is still a thread that is making progress. But it would be nice to have a callback from the RapidsCatalog to HostAlloc when a buffer changes state so it could be spilled. This would allow us to wake up blocked threads more quickly, instead of waiting for a buffer to be released, which is what we have for a callback right now.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nA callback from the RapidsBufferCatalog to HostAlloc when a host buffer changes to a state where it could be spilled.
