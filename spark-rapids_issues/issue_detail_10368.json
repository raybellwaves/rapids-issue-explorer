Please describe.**\r\nhttps://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/pull/10248 is adding in a new way to do unbounded to unbounded aggregations that are arguably much better than the BatchedDoublePass window optimization that we have today.  This is to extend it to add in support for  min, max, and count aggregations with the new method and remove the DoublePassWindow functionality.\r\n\r\nNote that we need to finish making the aggregation operations inside of it generic enough to handle all of these operators first, and then second we also need to make sure that we support the situation with no partitions.\r\n",
