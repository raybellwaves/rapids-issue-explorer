    "body": "The `GpuDynamicPartitionDataConcurrentWriter` subclasses `GpuDynamicPartitionDataSingleWriter` and has logic to deal with multiple `ColumnarOutputWriters` open at the same time within a `WriterStatus`.\r\n\r\nThis is a bit odd because a `WriterStatus` has its own `ColumnarOutputWriter`, and since the concurrent writer subclasses the single writer, it also has a different `ColumnarOutputWriter` that is not used.\r\n\r\nThis code also calls `close` on `ColumnarOutputWriter` several time, where other writers null out the `ColumnarOutputWriter` and make sure not to call `close` after the first time. \r\n\r\nI think some re-architecture is due here to clean it up and make it easier to reason about.",
