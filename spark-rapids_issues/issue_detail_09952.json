    "body": "Scala 2.13 migrated `scala.Seq` to an alias for the `scala.collection.immutable.Seq` instead of the `scala.collection.mutable.Seq`. Apache Spark (https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/66c6aab8f8b5168a77c86df9fa043068fc8b4b72) identified this a potential performance hit of 20% in their code.\r\n\r\nIn the Spark PR, they replaced a couple of key usages with `scala.collection.Seq` which is the mutable sequence in both versions of Scala. This ensures the types are the same in both versions, so the performance difference is only due to any underlying Scala version difference that we would not control. We should do the same.\r\n",
