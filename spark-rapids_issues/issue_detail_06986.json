If we have a way to guess how much memory is going to be used for a write we can now detect if the input batch is so large it would violate our assumption that we would go over 4x the target batch size, then we should split the input table instead of coalesce the data. If we run into situations where we run out of memory on a write before #6981 is done, then we should implement this first.",
