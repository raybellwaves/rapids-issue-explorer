Please describe.**\r\nfor https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/1072  we put in changes to optimize the copy of Arrow data read by HostColumarToGpu for primitive types and strings. We did not add support for Decimal or nested types.\r\n\r\nDecimal actually isn't supported in the cudf from_arrow type code, so we would need that first. The other nested types for struct and list are supported so we just need the jni side.",
