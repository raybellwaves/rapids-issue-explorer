    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nThe avro file reader now uses readDataSchema directly as the schema for reading the file, instead of checking whether each column exists in the file and uses a supported type. It may cause some problems when the user specifies an invalid read schema.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nWe can add an evolved schema from readschema and dataSchema to do type checking and filtering, just like orc reader and parquet reader do.\r\n\r\nThe schema evolution should:\r\n- Add a column that is in the read schema but not in the file schema.\r\n- Remove a column that is not in the read schema, but is in the file schema.\r\n- Throw exceptions for types that are not supported by the GPU\r\n- Try to do a type conversion when the types are inconsistent\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\n[Schema evolution in Orc](https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/blob/branch-22.08/sql-plugin/src/main/scala/com/nvidia/spark/rapids/GpuOrcScan.scala#L586)\r\n\r\n[checkTypeCompatibility in Orc](https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/blob/branch-22.08/sql-plugin/src/main/scala/com/nvidia/spark/rapids/GpuOrcScan.scala#L1182)\r\n",
