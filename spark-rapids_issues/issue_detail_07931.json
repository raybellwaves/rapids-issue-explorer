    "body": "The [Scans section of the config document](https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/blob/branch-23.04/docs/configs.md#Scans) describe configs to control scans, but users may think that turning off a particular scan will turn off _all_ reads of the corresponding format which is not the case.  See #7636 as one example.  Scans are only used in datasource V2, but all of the formats listed in the scans section are actually using datasource V1 by default, and thus these scan configs will have no effect on queries using the default Spark configs.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to have the scans section discuss datasource V1 vs. V2 and point to the spark.rapids.sql.format.*.enabled configs, which in almost all cases will be the preferable way to control whether reads of a particular format are on the GPU or not.",
