Please describe.**\r\nI wish the Profiling Tool would make it possible to compare metrics between the queries of a single app\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nIt's common  for the user to experiment with GPU vs CPU by simply toggling the conf `spark.rapids.sql.enabled` within a single REPL/notebook SparkSession. \r\n\r\nAlso most of spark-rapids tests are written with a flabor of assert_cpu_and_gpu_eqauls  executing the same query twice.\r\n\r\nIt would be great to be able to report the metric diffs between queries identified by ID's or the job description as in the [test case](https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/pull/2520#issuecomment-849245551).\r\n\r\nFor tests the the A/B sides of the diff can be identified automatically \r\n\r\n| jobId | description |\r\n| ------ | --------------- |\r\n| 31 | src/main/python/sort_test.py::test_large_orderby_nested_ridealong[Array(Byte)] (call)[GPU]collect at /home/gshegalov/gits/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/integration_tests/src/main/python/asserts.py:184 |\r\n| 30 | src/main/python/sort_test.py::test_large_orderby_nested_ridealong[Array(Byte)] (call)[GPU]collect at /home/gshegalov/gits/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/integration_tests/src/main/python/asserts.py:184 |\r\n| 29 | src/main/python/sort_test.py::test_large_orderby_nested_ridealong[Array(Byte)] (call)[CPU]collect at /home/gshegalov/gits/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/integration_tests/src/main/python/asserts.py:184 |\r\n| 28 | src/main/python/sort_test.py::test_large_orderby_nested_ridealong[Array(Byte)] (call)[CPU]collect at /home/gshegalov/gits/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/integration_tests/src/main/python/asserts.py:184 |\r\n\r\nby using \r\n- the prefix of the job description `src/main/python/sort_test.py::test_large_orderby_nested_ridealong[Array(Byte)] (call)` as the \"experiment id\" \r\n- the prefix of jobs `src/main/python/sort_test.py::test_large_orderby_nested_ridealong[Array(Byte)] (call)[CPU]` to group and aggregate metrics on the CPU query\r\n- the prefix `src/main/python/sort_test.py::test_large_orderby_nested_ridealong[Array(Byte)] (call)[GPU]` to group and aggregate metrics for the GPU counterpart query.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nOne can redo the experiment and  restart the Spark session to produce subsequent event logs for comparison, but it may be difficult.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nN/A",
