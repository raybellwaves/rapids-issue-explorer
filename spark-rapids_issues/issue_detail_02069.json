CUDF sees any white space at the end after the quote and assumes that all of the data should be a part of the string so it produces a value of `\"A\"  `\r\n\r\n**Steps/Code to reproduce bug**\r\nWe have an integration test for this in the CSV tests. `test_basic_read` for the file `ints_with_whitespace.csv` but with the schema for strings instead of bytes.",
