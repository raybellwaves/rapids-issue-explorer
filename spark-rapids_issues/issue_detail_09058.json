Please describe.**\r\nCUDF recently added V2 parquet headers write support. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/pull/13751\r\n\r\nSpark controls this same functionality by setting \"parquet.writer.version\" to \"v2\" on Spark 3.3.0 or later. This has some advantages and we should ideally expose this functionality if CUDF is also going to make it available to us.  The biggest drawback here is going to be testing it. In the worst case we might need to pick apart the file to make sure it is doing the right thing. \r\n",
