    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nCUDF is not interested in maintaining strict limits on memory usage for given algorithms. They are happy to fix any bugs we find with overflows, but testing for overflows is going to be difficult.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nWe need some tests that run regularly (nightly ideally, but weekly if we have to) that would get access to high end hardware, like an a100 80GB where we can test limitations on some algorithms.  This would include things like joins, hash aggregates, string operations, etc. \r\n\r\nThere are really two goals here\r\n\r\n 1. find limitations in various algorithms used by the plugin and verify that there are no regressions in the scale of these algorithms over time.\r\n 2. For the various operators that need to estimate memory usage this is intended to be a framework where we can verify that the estimates are accurate up to large amounts of input data.\r\n\r\nThe second one is a little bit harder compared to regular testing.  We can and should fail if the estimate is under the actual amount used.  But we should also try to track the amount we are under and see if we can find either opportunities to be more accurate in our estimates or see if CUDF begins to use less memory for specific operations.",
