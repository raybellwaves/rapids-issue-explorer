    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nToday we concatenate the shuffle buffers being received for a stage on the CPU before sending to the GPU because we want to avoid grabbing the GPU semaphore while waiting for shuffle I/O for the next buffer and avoid lots of tiny copies to the GPU.  However if the shuffle amount is quite large for a task then there can be significant time spent concatenating the data on the CPU before sending to the GPU.  There's also potentially a lot of Java overhead by creating Java-side tracking objects for all the columns in all the serialized shuffle buffers.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\ncudf has a packed table metadata structure which we could leverage (or something very similar) for a serialization format.  This format would be opaque to Java code, so no need to create table- and column-level tracking objects.  A serialized shuffle partition would consist of the packed metadata followed by the packed table data.  This would be sent to native code which would place them in fixed-size buffers in pinned memory (or tracked separately if the partition is larger than the fixed-size).  Once all shuffle buffers have been collected or we have reached the target batch size, native code would copy the fixed-size buffers that comprise the batch down to the GPU and have the GPU perform the concatenate.  This should be significantly faster than having the CPU perform the concatenation.\r\n\r\nWe may want a heuristic where we still concatenate the data on the CPU-side if the batch is relatively small, as the overhead of invoking the concatenate on the GPU side may be too expensive for tiny amounts of data relative to a CPU-side concatenate.",
