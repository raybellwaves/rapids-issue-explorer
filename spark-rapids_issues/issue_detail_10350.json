    "body": "@gerashegalov noted that an exception thrown during one of the sub-component shutdowns (e.g.: GpuDeviceManager.shutdown) will prevent subsequent shutdown calls from occurring since the RapidsExecutorPlugin shutdown is not prepared to handle exceptions being thrown from any of the shutdown methods called.  We should harden the RapidsDriverPlugin and RapidsExecutorPlugin shutdown calls to gather any exceptions thrown and throw one exception at the end of all shutdowns if one was thrown.  This logic would be similar to that of `safeClose` where any exception thrown after the first would be treated as suppressed exceptions tacked onto the first exception.",
