Please describe.**\r\nThere are some significant limitations in our CSV integration tests with respect to parsing dates and timestamps.\r\n\r\n- We only test with explicitly setting dateFormat and do not test the case where we do not specify a dateFormat\r\n- We only test by round-tripping with valid dates. We are not testing with generated string data containing a mix of valid and invalid dates.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nSee https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/pull/9975 where the JSON tests were improved. We should be able to apply similar changes to the CSV tests.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\n",
