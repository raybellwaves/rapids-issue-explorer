Please describe.**\r\nI did a bunch of manual testing of the Big Data Gen framework, but it would be good to have some actual tests to make sure that it does what it says it does. \r\n\r\nA lot of these tests would probably do things like distinct counts or bucketed counts to verify that the distributions look good and that things don't crash instead of verifying that the values are exactly what we expect.",
