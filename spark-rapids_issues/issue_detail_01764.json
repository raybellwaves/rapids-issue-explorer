    "body": "From https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/5225 it is obvious that there are some corner cases that cause issues with float/double tests.  Some of these are being fixed as a part of https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/pull/7410 but our tests are really inadequate despite fuzzing.  Really the issue is that we are only testing with 100 values and that the values themselves will never produce invalid values that overflow. They also will never in practice hit a Double.MaxValue or Double.MinValue.  It would be nice to have some special tests to augment these.",
