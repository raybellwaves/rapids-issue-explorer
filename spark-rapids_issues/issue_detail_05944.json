    "body": "#5941 adds basic support for Iceberg reads but it currently crashes at task runtime when an Iceberg scan is found that has delete operations that need to be applied by the reader.  It should be possible to detect these delete operations at query planning time after the driver collects the Iceberg table metadata as part of planning the scan.  See `FileScanTask#deletes`.  Falling back for reader-applied deletes at query planning time allows the query to complete (albeit as a CPU scan) rather than crashing the query as it does now.",
