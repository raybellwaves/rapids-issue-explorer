    "body": "There's separate Spark330PlusShims and Spark330PlusNonDB shims which implies Spark330PlusShims is used by all Spark 3.3+ platforms including the Databricks platforms.  However this is not the case.  Spark330PlusShims are only used by non-Databricks platforms.\r\n\r\nTo make it even more confusing , Spark330PlusNonDB shim derives from Spark330PlusShims but confusingly spark330's SparkShims do not derive from Spark330PlusNonDBShims, instead it derives from Spark330PlusShims despite spark331's version deriving from Spark330PlusNonDBShims.\r\n\r\nIt looks like there's a similar confusion with Spark331PlusShims not being used by all Spark versions >= 3.3.1.",
