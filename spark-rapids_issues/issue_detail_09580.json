Please describe.**\r\n\r\nCUDF has just finished https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/11844 and should now fully support nested types everywhere. This is really great, but now we should go back through all of our plugin code and audit the code to make sure that we have nested types enabled everywhere.  Any place where we don't have full nested type support enabled we should file follow on issues to enable it and add tests for it. Unless of course someone just wants to do ti all at once.",
