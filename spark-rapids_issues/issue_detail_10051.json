The self-contained pom should contain just enough details for the artifact to be used as a dependency for external projects and for dependency:get not require any intermediate poms. This may be achievable by `flatten:flatten` or some similar custom logic whose output will be used with deploy:deploy-file.\r\n\r\nNote that this issue is only about the poms that are published externally to Central for other projects to consume spark-rapids as a dependency, which we already massage before deploying. \r\n\r\nWe should feel free to maintain any form most suitable for building spark-rapids.
