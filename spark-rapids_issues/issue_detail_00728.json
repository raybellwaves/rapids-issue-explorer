I see this locally as well, so this seems like a configuration issue perhaps.\r\n\r\nHere are instructions on how to generate the report locally:\r\nhttps://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/blob/branch-0.2/docs/dev/README.md#code-coverage\r\n\r\nFrom my understanding the udf compiler should be almost fully covered with the unit tests, so it would be really great to bubble that up to the report.\r\n\r\n@seanprime7 @wjxiz1992 for visibility",
