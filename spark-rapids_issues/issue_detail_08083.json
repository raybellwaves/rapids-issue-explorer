So `spark.serializer` and `spark.kryo.registrator` are both specified. If the registrator isn't `GpuKryoRegistrator` we log a warning, which is easy to miss. https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/blob/branch-23.04/sql-plugin/src/main/scala/com/nvidia/spark/rapids/Plugin.scala#L129. \r\n\r\nI am wondering if we could do better here as from the looks of the Spark code the `SerializerManager` and `Kryo` are up and running at this point. Could we add a static variable somewhere that tells us that our registration code was called in `GpuKryoRegistrator` and if not throw an exception?\r\n",
