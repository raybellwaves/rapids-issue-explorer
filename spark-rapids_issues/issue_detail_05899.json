    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nIt would be nice to be able to tell what type of reader we use with Parquet, Orc, etc.  If user specifies it we can see config but otherwise we auto configure based on inputs. The reason it matters is the metrics are slightly different depending on which parts are multi-threaded.  For instance with Coalescing reader, buffer time isn't multi-threaded but the actual read fs time is.  With the multi-threaded cloud reader, the buffer time is multi-threaded.\r\n\r\nThe times are officially correct but depending on what you are comparing to it would be confusing. For instance your buffer time could be higher than your overall task time in the cloud reader.  \r\n\r\nWe could also revisit to try to make it more consistent between readers but we will likely have some metric that is different.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to see this in Spark UI and/or in profiling tool.",
