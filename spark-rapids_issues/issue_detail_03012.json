    "body": "While debugging a problem with Parquet partitioned writes, I noticed that `GpuInsertIntoHadoopFsRelationCommand` and `GpuCreateDataSourceTableAsSelectCommand` have a coalesce goal of a forced single batch if bucketed or partitioned writes are being used.  However in `GpuFileFormatWriter` it uses an out-of-core sorter to perform the sort.  Therefore I don't think it needs to force a single batch even for bucketed or partitioned writes unless stable sorting is configured which currently requires a single batch.\r\n",
