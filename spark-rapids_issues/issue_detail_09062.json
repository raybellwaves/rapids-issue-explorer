    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n@ttnghia brought up an interesting point offline today. When we split the data we are copying the data out. Part of the reason for this is because the java API does not support the logical split API that the C++ API does support. The reason for this is all about tracking the column views that would point back to the original columns.\r\n\r\nIf/when we ever do support that feature it would be interesting to explore doing a logical slice instead of one that does a copy.  We may still want to copy data out at some point to allow more data to spill.",
