Please describe.**\r\nAs seen in many issues related to cudf like #7454, error messages in cudf exceptions are notoriously cryptic for a Spark user.\r\n\r\nNot only `ai.rapids.cudf.CudfException: CUDF failure at:thirdparty/cudf/cpp/src/binaryop/binaryop.cpp:205: Unsupported operator for these types` does not mention cudf types but even if it did. it does not convey what Spark expression/types triggered it.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nIntercept all cudf exceptions in spark-rapids to wrap it into a plugin exception with the relevant Spark plan information. Eg if a binary expression evaluation throws in cudf, add stringified `left` and `right` info, which made repro in #7454 easy \r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nreproducing customer queries, attaching debugger, adding instrumentation for debugging only \r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n",
