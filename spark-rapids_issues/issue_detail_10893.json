However this cannot be done as a simple integration test since it requires special startup-only configs.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nAdd an explicit section to the spark-tests script that will launch sample self-profiling sessions.  The tests should minimally startup the Spark session with the profiling path prefix config pointing to a filesystem (distributed would be best, but local could be used if no distributed filesystem is available/configured in the test environment).  A simple, sample query can be run in the Spark session, and the test script can verify a profile is created at the expected destination.  It can then further verify the profile data by using the profile converter in NVIDIA/spark-rapids-jni#2066 to convert the data to JSON and grep the results for lkey profiling landmarks, e.g.: kernel names, Acquire GPU or other common NVTX ranges, etc.",
