    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nThis depends on #6835 and possibly on more.  The issue here is that we need to parse a string to a timestamp in a different time zone.  But we already don't really support parsing timestamps correctly as is. This is disabled by default. We require the year to be a full 4 digit year. We don't support all of the formats that cast does and we don't support parsing the time in a different timezone.\r\n\r\nHopefully we can just reuse the existing code and then convert the result to UTC using #6831 but we are going to have to do a lot of testing to see if that works. This might require that we write a custom kernel to do some of this. We might need to write a custom kernel at some point soon anyways to speed up timestamp parsing and to allow us to parse out time zones that could be included per string. \r\n\r\nThis is a fundamentally different problem than the other ones that pull out a part of a value from a timestamp. This is why it is a stand alone issue.",
