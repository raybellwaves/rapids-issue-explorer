    "body": "Originally this was a request to support some very basic operations on `Dataset[Row]`, but `Dataset` encompasses a lot more than that, This is to do a research spike and look at a lot of simple `Dataset` operations. Things like using simple case classes to hold data that can be translated back and forth to structs/rows.\r\n\r\nOnce we understand better how DataSets work and are translated to/from DataFrames we should be able to come up with a plan on how to add in limited support for executing DataSets on the GPU.  Some operations like `flatMapGroups` may be very difficult to analyze because they take and produce iterators, others like `select` might be a lot more simple to implement.\r\n\r\nThe result of this should be a design document with a proposal on how we could start to support some parts of the DataSet API.\r\n\r\n**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nI use `groupByKey()` which returns `KeyValueGroupedDataset[String, Row]`,\r\nthen `flatMapGroups()` which returns `Dataset[Row]`.\r\n\r\nAccording to [Is the Spark Dataset API supported?](https://nvidia.github.io/spark-rapids/docs/FAQ.html#is-the-spark-dataset-api-supported), spark-rapids should support `Dataset[Row]`.\r\nHowever driver.log shows following operators are not supported:\r\n`StaticInvoke` `ValidateExternalType` `GetExternalRowField` `AssertNotNull` `BoundReference`\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nNone.\r\n",
