Please describe.**\r\nThe SQL plugin supports partitioned writes but not bucketed writes.  the main thing preventing this from working is consistent hashing between the CPU and GPU implementations.  This will require us to create a version of the murmur3 hash the matches exactly with what spark does and may need us to write it ourselves as it is likely to be spark specific.",
