It no longer receives community updates.  \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n1. Remove Spark 3.1.x shims\r\n2. We should have removed documentation references to 3.1 support at this point.  We need to scrub and reconfirm there are no mentions of Spark 3.1.x support.  \r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\n",
