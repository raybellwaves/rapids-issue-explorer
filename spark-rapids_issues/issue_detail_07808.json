If you clicks on the jobs in that sql statement and look at the DAG Visualization it shows that it was GPU execs though.  \r\n\r\nWe should investigate what might be messed up the UI.\r\n\r\nI tried disabling Delta writes but it didn't make a difference.  this was using 23.04-20230215 snapshot jar.",
