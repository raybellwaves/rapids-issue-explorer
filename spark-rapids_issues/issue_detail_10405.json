Please describe.**\r\nWe recently disabled `get_json_object` and `from_json` by default because of errors that can crop up when using them. But we didn't do the same kind of thing for `json_tuple`. Our `json_tuple` is implemented in terms of `get_json_object`. It is not perfect, but it probably has the same issues with escaping that `get_json_object` also has, which caused it to be disabled by default. We should spend some more time testing it and see if we need to also disable it by default. At least until the issues with `get_json_object` are fixed.",
