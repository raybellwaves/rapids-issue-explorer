I think some kind of fuzz testing like we did for the device blocking APIs would be good. https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids-jni/blob/branch-23.08/src/test/java/com/nvidia/spark/rapids/jni/RmmSparkMonteCarlo.java is that code, but I don't think we need to do a full monte carlo simulation for performance. This would be more of just a fuzz tester.\r\n\r\nWe should also make sure that we have tests that verify specific cases.",
