Please describe.**\r\n`with_spark_session` should not allowed to be nested because it will lead to some unexpected behaviors.\r\n\r\n`with_spark_session` calls `reset_spark_session_conf` which does more than just reset the conf. \r\n\r\nIt clears out the catalog too with no way to get the original config or catalog back after it exits. \r\n\r\nThat means `with_gpu_session` -> `with_cpu_session` will result in the GPU query running on the CPU after the `with_cpu_session`.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nThrow an exception if `with_spark_session` is nested inside another `with_spark_session`.\r\nIf there are some nested `with_spark_session` in current integration test, we should also fix them.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThis is a follow-on issue of #9405\r\n",
