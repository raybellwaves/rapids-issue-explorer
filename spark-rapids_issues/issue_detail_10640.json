Please describe.**\r\nWe have not done much of anything with NVRTC or JIT recently because the time to compile code was so high it did not pay for itself. This is especially true when we have no good way to cache the JIT results, because we are in the cloud.\r\n\r\nThere have been some recent advances in NVRTC compile times in CUDA 12.4.\r\n\r\nWe should try it out again to see if we can come up with a solution for really hard problems where we would use AST if it actually supported all of the operators that we would want.",
