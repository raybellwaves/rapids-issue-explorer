Please describe.**\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/commit/861cca3da4c / https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/45064 modified StringType so now it can have a collation id associated with it.  The scare part is that this changes how strings can be compared.\r\n\r\nSee https://unicode-org.github.io/icu-docs/apidoc/dev/icu4j/com/ibm/icu/text/Collator.html for some more details on this, as this is the library that Spark is using.\r\n\r\nThis is used in a lot of places, including joins. I don't know if it is used everywhere, but I think in general we really should just fall back to the CPU for any StringType that we see that has a non-0 string type, the new method `isDefaultCollation` would need to return false. The other problem is that any place that we use a case statement to check the type of a string might need to be shimmed as StringType is not longer a case object, but is an actual case class.",
