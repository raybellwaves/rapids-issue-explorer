Please describe.**\r\nWe recently found a bug where a having multiple batches on the build side of a join for for some types of joins could cause data corruption.  This was because there was some kind of an optimization that only the second batch... What the important thing is our integration tests would have caught it if we had join tests that included multiple batches on the build side. We need to reevaluate if we have tests that could be updated to cover this and either update a few existing tests to get better coverage for joins with multiple batches or add new tests to do so.\r\n",
