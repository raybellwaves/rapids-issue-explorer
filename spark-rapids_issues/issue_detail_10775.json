Compile everything with `mvn -Dbuildver=330 install -DskipTests`\r\n2. Pick a test case name in the above table\r\n3. Go to RapidsTestSettings and find the line starting with \".exclude\" and containing the test case name, comment it out\r\n4. Run the Suite then you'll see one failed test case. E.g. `mvn -nsu -Dbuildver=330 -pl tests -Dsuites=\"org.apache.spark.sql.rapids.suites.RapidsXXXSuite\" test` (replace RapidsXXXSuite with the right name in issue header). ALWAYS double check if your suite name coincide with in source code, as it may contain typos!\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe suite can pass without excluding any test case.\r\n",
