    "body": "There are places in the plugin where it switches on the Spark type and performs some type-specific logic.  TimestampNTZType was added in Spark 3.2+ but there are places in the code where TimestampNTZType is missing from the type-handling logic.  The type converters in GpuRowToColumnarExec and GpuColumnarToRowExec is one example, GpuColumnVector.toRapidsOrNull is another.  We need to add proper handling of TimestampNTZType in all the places that are switching on Spark types.  Checking the places that are looking for TimestampType would probably grab a superset of the places that need updating.",
