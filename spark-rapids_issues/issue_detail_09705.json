Please describe.**\nIn PR https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/pull/9612, full StringGen is disabled due to a difference in encoding of two-digit unicode characters between cuDF and Spark.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nThis issue is unlikely to impact users but means we do not have comprehensive testing because we can't use full StringGen. It would be nice if we could use StringGen and disable characters between 0x00 and 0xFF.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\n\n\n**Additional context**\n\n",
