    "body": "As part of [apache/spark@4321604fe0](https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/4321604fe0) Spark added a new data member `stateful` to the expression class (to replace the Stateful trait).  Being `stateful` mainly impacts how expressions are copied.\r\n\r\nI'm not certain if this will impact the plugin, but we may need to set `stateful = true` for `GpuMonotonicallyIncreasingID`.\r\nPrior to this change `Stateful` implied `Nondeterministic`, but this is no longer true - you can have a stateful node that is deterministic.  Should GpuRand be marked `stateful`?",
