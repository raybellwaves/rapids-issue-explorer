    "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\nWhen running TPCDS-Q78 in the integration tests against scale factor 1 data with decimals the ratio value comes back different than expected.\r\n\r\nWe get back a `0.57` vs a `0.58` for ratio on line 66. I'll try to debug this more and see what I can come up with.\r\n\r\nThis turned out to be how Spark implements round vs how cudf does it. I personally think that cudf is more correct than the java/spark version but that is kind of irrelevant.  Round for floating point has been disable by default in #1609. So this is going to wait until we have a customer that has to have this or until we can figure out how to make ll the crazy java conversions happen.\r\n\r\n**Steps/Code to reproduce bug**\r\nFor now there is a slight bug in the code and you need to apply \r\n\r\n```diff\r\ndiff --git a/integration_tests/src/main/python/conftest.py b/integration_tests/src/main/python/conftest.py\r\nindex 8339f0bb..54a3bcdb 100644\r\n--- a/integration_tests/src/main/python/conftest.py\r\n+++ b/integration_tests/src/main/python/conftest.py\r\n@@ -371,7 +371,7 @@ class TpcdsRunner:\r\n     }\r\n     if not self.tpcds_format in formats:\r\n         raise RuntimeError(\"{} is not a supported tpcds input type\".format(self.tpcds_format))\r\n-    formats.get(self.tpcds_format)(jvm_session, self.tpcds_path, True)\r\n+    formats.get(self.tpcds_format)(jvm_session, self.tpcds_path, True, True)\r\n \r\n   def do_test_query(self, query):\r\n     spark = get_spark_i_know_what_i_am_doing()\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe test should pass",
