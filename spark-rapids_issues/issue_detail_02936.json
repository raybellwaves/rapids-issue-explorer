Please describe.**\r\nI noticed that we only implement ANSI mode for a subset of CAST operations and even for those I am not sure if we are implementing it consistently. We have a lack of test coverage as well.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI propose that we write PySpark integration tests to cover the matrix of supported CAST operations, with and without ANSI mode enabled, using fuzzing to catch edge cases in all supported environments. We can ignore failing tests and file issues to resolve them.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nThe alternative is to keep expanding the Scala tests, but we can't easily run these in all environments.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nNone\r\n",
