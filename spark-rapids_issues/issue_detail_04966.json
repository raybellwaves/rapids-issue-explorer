    "body": "We currently concat on the CPU before sending the data to the GPU. We should do a study to see if the there is a performance improvement by doing the concat on the GPU, and if so what are the situations.  Specifically I have a case where having too much data going to a hash aggregate causes later batches to be read and concated on the CPU while the GPU semaphore is held. It would be nice to see if we could speed this up some. Specifically if we know that the semaphore is held already and we know that the individual batches are large enough to not cause a draw call problem.\r\n\r\nIt might even be interesting to see if there are situations where we can do the concat by issuing memcpy async calls directly from host memory to the GPU.
