Please describe.**\r\nhttps://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/pull/9023 made it so that test_map_scalars_supported_key_types would not fail if a `WindowLocalExec` was in the plan.  That is fine as a short term fix to get a release out, but it is not a good long term fix.  We either need to support that operator, which means we would need a shim specific to dataproc now that they are not as close to open source any more, or we would need to skip the test on that platform.  If we do skip the test we should have a follow on issue to add in support for it eventually.",
