Please describe.**\r\nThis issue is based on the comment from @tgravescs in the spark-rapids-tools [PR-654](https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids-tools/pull/654#discussion_r1391367761) . Currently the code to tag unsupported operators is not written with the goal of parsing the output. Spark-rapids-tools is going to parse driver log to detect all the unsupported operators. We need to formalize the tagging in spark-rapids. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nCopied from the comment in the PR: \r\nWe should change the format for the future if we are planning on having tools about it. Maybe something more official tags [NOT ON GPU] that is easily parseable and unique. Obviously will still have to keep old logic for anything up til that get implemented.\r\n",
