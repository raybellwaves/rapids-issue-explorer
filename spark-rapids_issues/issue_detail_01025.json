    "body": "I'd like to add the following metrics to the RAPIDS shuffle:\r\n\r\n1. Peer bandwidth histogram: this should help figure out what BW is normally achievable for a peer.\r\n2. Peer send/receive time histogram: shows the latency to the peer => helping find slow peers.\r\n3. Peer message size histogram: shows whether most of the time the bounce buffers are being fully utilized\r\n4. Bounce buffer blocked time (send or receiver)\r\n5. Inflight wait time (receiver): time waiting for inflight limits on the client.\r\n\r\nMost of these are not easily attributed to a task, so these are all executor-level metrics.\r\n\r\n",
