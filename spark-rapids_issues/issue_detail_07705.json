    "body": "This task is to look at changing the priorities so that they can incorporate buffer size, as @revans2 has mentioned in different occasions. \r\n\r\nAt the time of spill when faced with the decision on what to move to the host, it may make sense to try and spill the buffer that is most \"right sized\" to the failed allocation (if 300MB failed to allocate, find a buffer that is 300MB or a bit above).\r\n\r\nI think this needs to come with a deeper understanding of the async allocator defragmentation guarantees. If it would be better to find smaller buffers, synchronize, and then retry, perhaps that is a cheaper option (presumably the 300MB+ buffer took longer to compute). That is why this is a research task, to make an informed decision of how this heuristic should work.",
