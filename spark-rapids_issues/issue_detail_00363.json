Please describe.**\r\nIn accordance with https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-knodel-terminology-00.html , remove oppressive language from the codebase.  Specifically the words slave and master which appear in code, comments and documentation.  They can be replaced with primary / secondary or in the case of Spark, primary / {worker / executor}.  \r\n\r\n**Steps/Code to reproduce bug**\r\nSearch the codebase for master, slave and make sure they do not appear.  The words whitelist and blacklist have been removed from the codebase already.  \r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe code will continue to work as before.  \r\n\r\n**Environment details (please complete the following information)**\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThe words whitelist and blacklist have already been removed.  \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nSearch the codebase and documentation for master, slave and make sure they do not appear.  \r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nhttps://developers.google.com/style/inclusive-documentation\r\n\r\nChanges in Spark: \r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-32004 Drop references to slave\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-32036 Remove references to \"blacklist\"/\"whitelist\" language (outside of blacklisting feature)\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-32037 Rename blacklisting feature to avoid language with racist connotation\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-32333 Drop references to Master\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
