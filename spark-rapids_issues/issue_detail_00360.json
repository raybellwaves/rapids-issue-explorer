Please describe.**\r\nTo make sure our scala tests are not mistakenly running on the CPU, we put an explicit check in the GpuTransitionOverrides.scala to make sure none of the children of `InMemoryTableScanExec` were anything but `AttributeReference`. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nScala tests automatically repartition the data to make sure we don't run into this situation and now that we have most of our tests in python, we may not need this check",
