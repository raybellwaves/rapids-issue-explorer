    "body": "Parquet oddly supports having the footer in a separate file from the columns in a row group. I don't know of anyone who uses this, but it should work on Spark because spark just asks Parquet to read the data (I think I am not 100% sure how to write a file like this s I have not tested it). It is clear from our code that we do not support this simply because the path is lost when we drop columns building the new file and then we don't even try to read it when we copy the data over. I also really doubt if CUDF supports this type of thing. So I thought it was best to at least document that we don't support it. But if Spark does not, then we don't even need to document it.",
