    "body": "We have run into a number of places recently where there are corner cases with old parquet data, or odd mixtures of things that are causing issues.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this is to really try hard to find corner cases for us to test for parquet and ORC.  This is likely going to require us to understand the file formats themselves and write out data in a way that Spark cannot do. This is like with #5445\r\n\r\nWe should also look deeply at schema evolution and what happens if I add new files that have a modified schema. What does the CPU do and how do we handle it?  Things like moving from an int to a long. We have implemented some of this for parquet but ORC is still really lacking #135 \r\n\r\nWe should look at features like with parquet having the data stored in a different file from the footer. Does anyone use this? If so does Spark with with this?\r\n\r\nTo be clear not all of this work needs to be done in one issue. We can split this up into multiple issues, and if we find bugs we need to make sure to file those bugs against us.",
