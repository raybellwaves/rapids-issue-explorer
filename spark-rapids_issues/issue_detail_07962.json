The material difference is that where the user might look in the plan for these metrics: [Old](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12025282/220267296-62d2deef-f8d8-4e71-adc6-23e416f0777c.png) vs [New](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12025282/220267151-dd1e7ed9-eb92-44a5-abdc-75f204ecf97e.png).\r\n\r\nThis might also be valuable for reducing differences when merging other Spark changes.\r\n(It doesn't look valuable enough to warrant shimming, though.)",
