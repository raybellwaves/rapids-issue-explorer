    "body": "In the RAPIDS Accelerator and in open-source Delta Lake, a delete of an entire partition in the file will result in a -1 result for the `num_affected_rows` result of the query.  This was also true of the Databricks Delta Lake implementation for a while, but recently it changed to apparently return the number of rows that were in the deleted files.  See #8111. \r\n\r\nThe RAPIDS Accelerator should be updated to match the behavior of Databricks Delta Lake delete regarding the computation of the `num_affected_rows` query result.\r\n",
