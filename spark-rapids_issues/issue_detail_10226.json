This is kind of scary and I would like to feel better about how correct the solution is by doing some more testing. Specifically with complicated JSON schemas, deeply nested data and deeply nested queries with wildcards in the middle.\r\n\r\nWe should probably look to see if there are other unit tests that we can find/reuse as well.",
