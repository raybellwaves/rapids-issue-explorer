    "body": "As mentioned here https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/6768, I am noticing the synchronizing on OOM can help us handle allocation failures that would otherwise be fatal. Additionally, with some quick prototyping locally, it seems that there may be a performance gain here.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, if we first `Cuda.deviceSynchronize` rather than spill right away, but fallback to the spill when we know we have already synchronized, we are able to save time with a quick query I tried in our performance cluster. I ran a query that spills constantly and it took 265 seconds vs 304 seconds without this change.\r\n\r\nThat said the query also ran OOM on a second trial. The reason I think is that we are really able to pack the GPU, I see that the async pool is able to get closer to its maximum size (40GB in this case). So we have less fudge memory for those tasks that run above their ~1/concurrentGpuTasks chunk of memory.",
