    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nhttps://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/pull/13924 added in a HostMemoryAllocator interface. But it also made using a non-default one on a per-API basis. This is what we wanted when I thought we could get memory limits without using the retry framework. After hitting some design issues it became clear that we have to use the retry framework for this. With that in mind we should just update the code so we have an API to set the default allocator use and that all allocations from java use that default allocator. We can either deprecate the per-API allocators or just remove them because I don't think that they are being used any more.\r\n\r\nOn the plugin side we will want to update the initialization code for HostAlloc to set this if there is a memory limit.\r\n\r\nAt the same time we can probably remove the reservation API from the pinned memory pool. It is not needed with the new design.",
