Please describe.**\r\n\r\n## High Priority\r\n\r\n### `GetJsonObject`/`get_json_object`\r\nget_json_object is being traced by a separate epic. One of them is in the spark-rapids repo and another is in spark-rapids-jni. The JNI version is trying to write a new parser from scratch to match what Spark is doing.\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/10254\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids-jni/issues/1823\r\n\r\n### `JsonTuple`/`json_tuple`\r\nFor now it is implemented in terms of multiple calls to `get_json_object`. This is likely to change in the future, but for now it should be tracked with `get_json_object`\r\n\r\n### `JsonToStructs` and `ScanJson`\r\n\r\n`JsonToStructs` and `ScanJson` share a common backend and most bugs in one are reflected in the other with the exception of a few issues that are specific to how `JsonToStructs` prepares it's input so that the CUDF JSON parser can handle it. \r\n\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/4609\r\n    - [ ] https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/4940\r\n    - [ ] https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/15318\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/10485\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/10453\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/7616\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/10483\r\n- [ ] #4608\r\n    - [x] https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/8827\r\n    - [ ] https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/15278\r\n    - [ ] https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/15260\r\n    - [ ] https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/14239\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/8558\r\n    - [ ] https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/15278 \r\n- [ ] https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/10489\r\n    - [ ] https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/15277\r\n- [ ] #4612\r\n    - [ ] https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/15222\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/7482\r\n- [x] https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/10486\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/10479\r\n    - [ ] https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/15222\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/10595\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/10596\r\n    - [ ]  https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/15303\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/7482\r\n\r\n## Medium Priority\r\n\r\n### `JsonToStructs` and `ScanJson`\r\n\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/10488\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/4951\r\n- [x] #4718\r\n- [ ] #4616\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/9774\r\n- [x] https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/9750\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/10458\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/10457\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/10534\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/10535\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/10607\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/10573\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/10574\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/10588\r\n\r\n## Low Priority\r\n\r\n### `JsonToStructs` and `ScanJson`\r\n\r\n- [ ] #4610\r\n- [ ] JSON reader: Support  `lineSep` configuration option\r\n- [ ] JSON reader: Support `multiLine` configuration option\r\n- [ ] JSON reader: Support `primitivesAsString` configuration option\r\n- [ ] JSON reader: Support `prefersDecimal` configuration option\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/9664\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/9723\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/9724\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/10495\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/10493\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/10539\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/10587\r\n    - [ ] https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/10266\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n### `JsonToStructs` and `ScanJson`\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/10491\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/10044\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/10492\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
