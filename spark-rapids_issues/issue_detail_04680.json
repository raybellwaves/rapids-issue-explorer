    "body": "The issue reported here https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/4664 shows an underlying design issue with the singleton `RapidsBufferStore`.\r\n\r\nIn the test, the `SparkSession` was being stopped to prevent other problems (see https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/pull/4669), but the underlying problem still remains: Is calling `.close()` on a session and creating a new session supported by Spark?\r\n\r\nFor shuffle specifically, when `.close()` is called on the session the `SparkContext` is also stopped, which resets the shuffle ids used and possibly ids for other blocks I haven't looked into (like broadcast blocks). The issue appears to be that stopping the context doesn't mean that `unregisterShuffle` calls are getting issued synchronously (hence the bug reported in #4664, because otherwise the store's block would have been removed). So there is some state that isn't clean when the context `.close()` returns, and there could be a late `unregisterShuffle`.\r\n\r\nAt this stage what we think should happen is that `RapidsBufferStore` should not be a singleton and somehow tied to the context. So that an `unregisterShuffle` (or other cleanup call) can be ignored for a store that was meant for a new context.",
