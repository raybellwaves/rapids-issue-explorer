    "body": "When we spill and read spilled data we get task level accumulators `gpuSpillBlockTime` and `gpuReadSpillTime` that are useful to figure out how much time a task (and a stage with rollup) spent either spilling or reading spilled data. \r\n\r\nWhen a job runs several stages, and some of them in parallel, it is a bit hard to figure out what is spilling: when a stage sees a high `gpuSpillBlockTime` is it spilling its own blocks? Or is it spilling a different stage? Additionally, it is not clear what part of the stage is generating blocks that end up getting spilled and read from host, we just know that something in the stage did given a high `gpuReadSpillTime`.\r\n\r\nI am not sure there's a great solution here but it would be try if tagging a spillable batch with some minimal information: TaskID + StageID + producing exec would be useful. The output could be logged in debug mode for instance and it could be used for development or debugging sessions to make sure we don't see odd old data getting spilled all of a sudden (a spillable leaked).
