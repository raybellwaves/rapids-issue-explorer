Please describe.**\r\n\r\nin #10850 we hard coded all expression based test suites to use UTC timezone, because UTC is the only timezone is that many expressions support now. \r\n\r\nIn the near future we want the Spark UT to be run in UTC as well as other timezone.\r\nThis issue will include two parts:\r\n1. remove the hard code UTC timezone in code\r\n2. Launch tests with different timezones (maybe in test environment setup script)\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nA clear and concise description of what you want to happen.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nA clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAdd any other context, code examples, or references to existing implementations about the feature request here.\r\n",
