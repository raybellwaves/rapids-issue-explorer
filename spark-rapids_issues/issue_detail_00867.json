Please describe.**\r\nWe already have a utility for generating a DOT file showing differences in SQL metrics between two runs of the same query. It would be useful to be able to just output a text diff as well.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nAdd a method to BenchUtil to show the query physical plan with metrics from both runs.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nN/A\r\n",
