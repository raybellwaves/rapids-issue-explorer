Ours is currently implemented in terms of `lhs.isNotNull.ifElse(lhs, rhs)`.  This works fine, but CUDF has a `replace_nulls` API now, that does exactly what we want, just faster.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/blob/9092b56c2c663c0377a501b2c7c0d5951f33458d/cpp/include/cudf/replace.hpp#L53\r\n\r\nWe should put in the JNI APIs if needed and then replace what we currently are doing with this new one.\r\n\r\nExtra bonus points if we can detect that someone is doing an if/else or case when operation that could be translated to this also, so we are calling less kernels and producing less intermediate data.\r\n",
