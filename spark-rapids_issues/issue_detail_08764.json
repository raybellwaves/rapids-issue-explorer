    "body": "We have added INJECT_OOM to the integration tests and we'd like to take it a step further. Currently, INJECT_OOM will fail on the first allocation when it has been setup (it is normally setup random in the integration tests), but we'd like to also randomize which allocation is going to fail each time, and have it be reported in test: \"INJECT_OOM_0\" would mean the first allocation, \"INJECT_OOM_9\" would be the tenth allocation for example. This is for repeatability so we can try and tackle a failure later.\r\n\r\nThe other improvement would be to add split and retry OOM. We know that we are in a withRetry that has a split policy so we could throw split and retry here just like we did for INJECT_OOM. We would need to also call out what is happening (INJECT_SPLIT_OOM?)",
