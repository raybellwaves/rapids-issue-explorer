    "body": "When Spark overflows with `AnsiCast` we get an exception like this:\r\n```\r\njava.lang.ArithmeticException: Casting 9223372036854775807 to int causes overflow\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut the plugin doesn't show the value that would overflow or what type we are casting to:\r\n```\r\njava.lang.ArithmeticException: overflow occurred\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be useful to improve our error message for ease of use. We can cast a column vector of longs to ints for example, and any given item in that column vector could have overflowed, so we may need to figure out how to summarize that. It seems \"cast from type X to type Y\" would be easy to implement.",
