We need to be a bit careful here because some host buffers can be on the driver, but generally https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/9862 should update the code so we are limiting the total memory used , but we need to add in retry block for most JCudfSerialzation usage.\r\n\r\nYou can skip the multi-threaded shuffle reader at this point it will be done in https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/8900\r\n\r\nYou also need to make sure that we look at the host GPU shuffle concat that happens after the shuffle data is read in for non-UCX shuffle.",
