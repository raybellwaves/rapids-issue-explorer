It would be nice to also compare the result schema so that we can be sure that we return the same column names, types, and nullability flags.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nUpdate the `assert_gpu_and_cpu_are_equal_*` methods to compare schema as well as results. We should add an option to disable these checks since there may be edge cases that we won't support.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nNone\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nN/A\r\n",
