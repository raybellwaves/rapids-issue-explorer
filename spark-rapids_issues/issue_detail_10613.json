Please describe.**\r\n```Rlike``` was an very expensive [cudf operation](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/blob/f9ac4277f50163a7da2006460034aa3e45c8744e/cpp/src/strings/contains.cu#L59)  compared to other operator like compare. One option is mentioned in https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/10600 that we can replace some cases with cheaper expression. Another option we could have is to introduce short-circuit evaluation to skip some regexp by prioritizing to evaluate those cheaper evaluations.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\n```\r\nrecord_name regexpr (.*[0-9]{2}) AND date BTWEEN `20201111` AND `20201112` AND length(store_names) > 15\r\n```\r\nFor condition mentioned above, we could optimize it by:\r\n1. Evaluate other conditions firstly other than regexp\r\n2. Support null masking filter on the fisrst 2 conditions and evaluate null masked data using regexp\r\n3. (nice to have) reorder date and length conditions on the fly based on its selectivity\r\n",
