    "body": "Followup to #6288.\r\n\r\nThe `spark-rapids` plugin currently supports querying `map` scalars only with key scalars. Map vectors can be queried with both scalar and vector keys. So the following query falls back to CPU:\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT MAP( 1, 'one', 2, 'two', 3, 'three' )[ my_key_column ] FROM my_table;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis *might* require the addition of a `map_scalar_view` in CUDF JNI, sharing a back-end with `maps_column_view`. \r\nAnother approach (Thanks, @revans2!) might be to unroll the map scalar into an `if-else`. This might be feasible since the map can't be too massive, given that it's specified as a constant in the query.",
