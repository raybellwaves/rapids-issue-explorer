    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nRight now AST is really only used in joins. We added in an AST Project as a way to easily test AST versions of various expressions, but no one has really done any serious benchmark to find out how good it might be. Some recent experimental work has indicated that for some operations a filter that could do AST operations might be very highly performant compared to a non-AST version.  We should take the time to explore what cases the AST operations are better than non-AST operations, and which cases they are not. If we see some big gains we should work with CUDF to add in AST filter support, and either turn on AST Project in cases where it would be best, or possibly update tiered project so that it could select some tiers to be executed using AST and not others.",
