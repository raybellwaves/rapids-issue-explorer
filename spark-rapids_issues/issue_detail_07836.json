Please describe.**\r\nCurrently to control the bytes read by our GPU readers by setting spark.sql.files.maxPartitionBytes, Generally we can set this to higher value then CPU.  The downside to setting this is that CPU execs are also affected so if you have an application that still runs somethings on CPU it can hurt those.  \r\n\r\nPerhaps we should create a spark.rapids.sql.files.maxPartitionBytes or something like that that only applies when a GPU reader takes affect",
