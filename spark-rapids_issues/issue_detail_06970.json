    "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\nThis is similar to https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/6968 but it is for maps.  In the parquet spec a map can be annotated with MAP_KEY_VALUE instead of MAP. But when CUDF sees this is does not treat it like a MAP, but returns the data without a LIST, and ends up throwing out some data. This corresponds to the test `MAP_KEY_VALUE` in https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/pull/6914\r\n\r\nThis is really a CUDF issue so I will file something there for this. But we will need to enable the test once it is fixed.",
