I do see it for the regular TableScanExec though.\r\n\r\n**Steps/Code to reproduce bug**\r\nSet up a query to use the ParquetCachedBatchSerializer and run something with it. With GPU enabled it will not show any metrics, but with the GPU disabled it will.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nWe should see metrics all the time.\r\n",
