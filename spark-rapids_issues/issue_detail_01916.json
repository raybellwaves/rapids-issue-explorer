Please describe.**\r\nIf users are using the stage level scheduling feature in spark 3.1.1 with our plugin, they won't be allowed to say create a new ResourceProfile with 2 GPUs if they want to use that for AI/ML because of our check in the plugin that requires only 1 GPU.\r\n\r\nie the case is ETL using the spark rapids plugin, use stage level scheduling to reconfigure containers to run ML, if that ML needs more then 1 GPU it fails currently.  \r\n\r\nThe other issue here might be that the plugin always initializes and currently stage level scheduling doesn't have a way to shut that off per ResourceProfile.  So perhaps we want config for that as well so that the plugin doesn't use GPU memory in a stage that wants GPU for ML.",
