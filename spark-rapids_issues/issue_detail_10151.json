But when this happens if the retry framework cannot handle it that original exception is lost and we cannot tell the difference between a real OOM and the string to too large OOM.\r\n\r\nIdeally we would keep the original exception around and pass it into the split code so that if it needed to throw something it could use that as the cause.",
