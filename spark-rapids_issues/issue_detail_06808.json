    "body": "Ideally we can provide some specific scenarios on when the multi-threaded shuffle should be enabled. In a nutshell, if there is spare CPU capacity. \r\n\r\nA good example is the case where a machine has more CPU cores than what we use for Spark running on the GPU. We see this plugin as a way make use of the idle cores. \r\n\r\nThere is another case that I'd like to document: With the GPU we use less CPU than Spark does (since we are offloading compute to the device), given the same number of executor threads. This extra CPU capacity is something else that we can take advantage of when working on CPU intensive tasks, like shuffle encode/decode.",
