Please describe.**\r\nWhen parsing CSV or JSON, and when casting from a string to a timestamp or a date it is allowed to have a timezone id in the string itself.  Ideally we should be able to support this. It might take some custom kernel work to do it. But if we can have the names of all of the time zones cached on the GPU along with the offset tables similar to what is described in https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/6831 and https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/6840 then we could detect zones that are UTC+/- and GMT +/- along with the actual named zones. (There are also aliases for UTC/etc that we will need a way to express too).  But with that, then the parsing code can look up the corresponding timezone and adjust the result appropriately when parsing the data.  This is likely going to need more custom kernels to make this fully work.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Parse to Timestamp\r\n- [ ] Parse to Date\r\n- [ ] Parse Just time https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/10221",
