    "body": "`LazySpillableGatherMap` allows us to obtain a `ColumnView` from the gather map  even though the gather map may turn itself spillable a short time after that. This means we have a view to something that could be freed, since the `ColumnView` doesn't count for the underlying `DeviceMemoryBuffer` reference count.\r\n\r\nThis helped expose https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/pull/8936, but it is something we should fix anyway. I expect the map to return an inc ref counted `RapidsDeviceMemoryBuffer` and the caller uses another function to turn it into a `ColumnView`. That way it is clear that the view won't be invalid, since you hold both references.",
