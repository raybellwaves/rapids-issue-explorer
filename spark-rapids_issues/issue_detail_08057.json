In order to not leave the largest batches for last (likely incurring spill costs), we would still have to process the entire build side first. Once we have pulled in the build side and repartitioned it the first time, we could then know which batches we would want to repartition a second time and how many sub-partitions we would need. But then we have to hand the same plan over to the steam side partitioner. We would have to be able to tell it what the seed is for the first partition pass and how many partitions to use, along with what partitions would need a second pass and the corresponding seeds and number of partitions for each of them.\r\n\r\nThis is a fairly large change, and it would be a performance improvement when we are in a memory constrained situation. So we would want to have a few queries that exhibited this behavior that we could use to benchmark it.",
