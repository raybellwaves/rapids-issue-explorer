    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\n`RLIKE`, `REGEXP` or `REGEXP_LIKE` are widely used but very expensive, and many use cases are quite simple and similar, like `^abc(.*)`, `(.*)abc$`, `pattern`, and `^pattern$`.\r\n\r\nThese pattern cases can be replaced with faster expressions like `GpuStartsWith`, `GpuEndsWith` or `GpuContains` when overriding. \r\n\r\nSome commonly used patterns are even worth to writing a custom kernel to match, such as `pattern[0-9]{3,4}` (some digits followed by a string) and `[\\u4e00-\\u9fa5]+` (any Chinese character).\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nWe have a regex parser in plugin code [here](https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/blob/branch-24.06/sql-plugin/src/main/scala/com/nvidia/spark/rapids/RegexParser.scala) to translate a regex pattern to cudf supported style and check fallback. We can reuse it if possible to match if it is a simple pattern that can be replaced, and replace that case to the faster expressions.\r\n\r\nHere is a list of planned/possible tasks:\r\n\r\n- [x] #10742\r\n- [x] #10821\r\n- [ ] #10976\r\n- [ ] Follow-up: Support PrefIxRange rewrite startsWith `^`\r\n- [ ] Follow-up: Support multiple ranges in PrefIxRange rewrite such as `prefix[a-zA-Z0-9]`\r\n- [ ] Benchmark testing on regex rewrite\r\n",
