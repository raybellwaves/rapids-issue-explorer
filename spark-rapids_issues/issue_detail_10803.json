We need tests for.\r\n\r\n  * get_json_object\r\n  * json_tuple\r\n  * from_json\r\n\r\nIt would also be nice to have benchmarks for, but they are less common from what we have seen\r\n\r\n  * the JSON input format\r\n  * to_json\r\n\r\nIdeally these benchmarks would include long JSON strings with multi-byte characters, and nesting up to 64 deep.\r\n\r\nfrom_json should include a large number of different data types, including arrays, maps, long strings, etc.\r\n\r\nget_json_object should include lots of different paths that also include arrays and wildcards.",
