    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nCUDF is in the middle of trying to increase the maximum amount of data a string column can hold. https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/13733\r\n\r\nI believe that the current proposal, but we need to work with CUDF on this, is to move the data for a string from a child column into the parent column. The offsets would stay as a child column and could either be 32-bits or 64-bits.\r\n\r\nWe will need changes to CUDF to support these differences and changes to the plugin as well.\r\n\r\nAnything that touches a string or an offset will need to be looked.\r\n\r\nWe need to verify that any place that we touch/use an offset that it is a long and not cast to an int unless we know that the offset originally came from an int offset column.\r\n\r\nWe need to be careful about conversions between strings and binary types, as binary and string will no longer have the same underlying structure and we might need some kernels to help with conversion between the two. This is particularly used in parquet reading, where if things are configured wrong we might get something different from what we expected.\r\n\r\nWe should get started on this early. First by identifying as many areas as we can that might be problems and breaking them down into issues so we can swarm them before CUDF makes a transition. Then have a small number of changes ready to go for what CUDF does switch. And hopefully we will have tested them all before hand as the CUDF patches are being developed.",
