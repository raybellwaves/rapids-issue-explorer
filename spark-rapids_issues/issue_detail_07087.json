    "body": "GPU Hive delimited text reader does not currently support escape characters.\r\n\r\nThe default Hive delimited text escape character is `'\\'`. This would allow special characters to be escaped, so as not to be interpreted during parsing.\r\nE.g. `\"\\\\N\"` would be interpreted as `\"\\N\"` instead of `null`.\r\n\r\nThis stems from the implementation of `GpuHiveTableScanExec` depending on CUDF's CSV Reader, which [does not support escape characters](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/11984) (AFAICT).\r\n\r\nDepends on https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/11984.",
