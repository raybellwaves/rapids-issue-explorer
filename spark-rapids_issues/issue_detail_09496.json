    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nCurrently we don't have a clear set of APIs describing the ```RapidsBuffer```'s state. To elaborate the state, it should provide enough information about:\r\n- Disk, host memory, device memory size currently it occupied. It will be used when freeing/spilling the buffer.\r\n- Compression state: compressed or not. If yes, the compression codec used.\r\n- Encryption state: encrypted or not (only available to CPU).\r\n- Pack state: Packed or not\r\n- Uncompressed size: the size needed when decompressed\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nRefine ```TableMeta``` and ```BufferMeta``` to cover those informations mentioned above.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nA clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThis is an extended discussion from [PR](https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/pull/9454) which aims to support compression/encryption in disk store.\r\n",
