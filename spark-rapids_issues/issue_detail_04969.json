Please describe.**\r\nPR https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/pull/4938 makes timestamp parsing more compatible with Spark when reading from JSON and CSV but it is very expensive because it has to apply regular expressions as well as performing multiple passes with different cuDF formats.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nWe should implement a custom kernel instead.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nNone\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nNone\r\n",
