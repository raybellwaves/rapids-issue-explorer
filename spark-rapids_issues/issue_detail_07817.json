The code previously and still after #7771 ensures a single batch is produced for the partial hash aggregate side as long as we fit within batch size limits, but we should only really require single batches for a final/complete aggregate. This issue is to investigate how bad is it if we output single batches and let the shuffle code handle smaller batches for the partial aggs.",
