    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nAs a part of the cache work I noticed that in some cases the performance of the GPU version when reading from the cache is really bad compared to the CPU.  When I looked at the code and did some profiling I found that most of the time was spent in converting the data from rows to columns.  Just putting the data in that format.  Not sending it to the GPU or anything like that. It appears on the surface that it might be related to how we do the iterators, and it might be worth our time to try and do some simple code generation similar to how InMemoryTableScanExec does the compressed columnar to row transition.\r\n\r\nI realize that the ideal fix for this particular situation is to just do all of the processing on the GPU and we are working on that, but there are other places where we transition the data in row format from the CPU to the GPU and making that work better would be great.",
