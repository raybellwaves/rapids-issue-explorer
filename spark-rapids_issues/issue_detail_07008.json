They would like help validating it like we did for ZSTD in https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/3037.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nWe would need to modify the plugin to use the GPU for ORC with DEFLATE as the compressor.   Then we can run tests to validate the data it produces.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nCUDF team could write tests more extensive tests to validate DEFLATE.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nCUDF team is hoping to enable this compressor in the 23.02 time-frame.",
