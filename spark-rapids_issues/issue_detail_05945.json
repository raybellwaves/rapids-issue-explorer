    "body": "#5941 adds basic support for Iceberg reads but it does not support Iceberg's `merge-on-read` delete mode supported in Iceberg format v2.  Supporting this involves supporting both types of delete filters:\r\n- positional deletes, identified by row number\r\n- equality filters\r\n\r\nEquality filters should be relatively straightforward, as we should be able to reuse code from `GpuFilter` to remove the relevant rows.  Positional deletes are like an \"anti-gather\" where we want to collect all rows _except_ the ones that have been enumerated. ",
