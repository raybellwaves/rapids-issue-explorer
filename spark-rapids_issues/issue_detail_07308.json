We should figure out if there are popular unit and integration testing frameworks for Spark and document how to turn on the RAPIDS accelerator for these tests. That way users can feel comfortable enabling the plugin, or doing development directly for the RAPIDS accelerator.\r\n\r\nI suspect most people are probably doing something like we are where they use an existing test framework, and just calling into spark to do it.  In those cases we should encourage people to start running those tests with the accelerator plugin.",
