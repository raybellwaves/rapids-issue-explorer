    "body": "Our current API in the shuffle transport exposes details of _how_ the transfer happens.\r\n\r\n- We have _tags_ exposed, and that is very much a concept of the tag api in UCX and other types of transports.\r\n- We have _bounce buffers_ exposed, which can also impede the transport from deciding to skip bounce buffers in some scenarios (removing extra copies).\r\n- The mechanics of transferring a block are very much application driven now (transfer request/transfer response). This should be abstracted away whenever possible.\r\n\r\nThe deliverable of this issue should be at first a sql-plugin sided api, and then a default implementation using the rapids shuffle code that leverages UCX (close to what we have now, but behind this interface) in that sub-module (shuffle-plugin).\r\n\r\nFor the current milestone, having the API documented and set in stone seems like a good deliverable, but my hope is to have more. Else I may file an impl issue to track that separately.",
