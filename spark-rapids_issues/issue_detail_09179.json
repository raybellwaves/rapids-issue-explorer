    "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\nI don't have a tone of information yet on this. I was trying to reproduce/debug some slowness with a specific query and it looked like it was related to a regular expression problem. I thought it might be related to a very large string, so I created a 300 KiB string with a lot of rows. The string was duplicated for each of the rows.  When I tried to read it in from parquet it would fail with out of memory errors because the split code could not deal with it yet.  When I turned off the parquet reader I got a segfault.\r\n\r\n```\r\n# A fatal error has been detected by the Java Runtime Environment:\r\n#\r\n#  SIGSEGV (0xb) at pc=0x00007fecf9052416, pid=1597425, tid=0x00007fecbc9f9700\r\n#\r\n# JRE version: OpenJDK Runtime Environment (8.0_382-b05) (build 1.8.0_382-8u382-ga-1~20.04.1-b05)\r\n# Java VM: OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (25.382-b05 mixed mode linux-amd64 compressed oops)\r\n# Problematic frame:\r\n# v  ~StubRoutines::jbyte_disjoint_arraycopy\r\n#\r\n# Failed to write core dump.
