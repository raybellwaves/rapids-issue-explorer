However we are trying to find an easier way to auto detect/fix similar issue, @gerashegalov suggested we could use markdown linter to do this in this [comment](https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/pull/7918#discussion_r1145375635), so I draft a [pr](https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/pull/7929) to add this tool in github action.\r\nIf I enable all rules, there are more than 20 thousand errors in our doc, so a better way is to just pick the rules which could raise formatting issue in our [webpage](https://nvidia.github.io/spark-rapids/), and add it in the config file.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84758614/227887119-2d9c9ca2-21ba-41eb-815d-5c16d4deed8c.png)\r\nhttps://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/actions/runs/4507566264/jobs/7935455262?pr=7929\r\nEven I only enable one MD032 rule(which raise the [formatting exception we hit](https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/pull/7918#issuecomment-1478968763)), there still 140 errors in our document, I checked some errors in our webpage but none of them has formatting issue, not sure if we could benefit from this tool with not much effort. The tool has auto fix feature, but I have a concern if it has too much updated.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84758614/227887886-bd9b3f85-b240-4fef-b1a1-b5cd6d653dbe.png)\r\nhttps://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/actions/runs/4507932014/jobs/7936177393?pr=7929\r\nAny insights?\r\n@gerashegalov @sameerz @viadea @GaryShen2008 ",
