But when I tried to do the following I got really bad performance.\r\n\r\n```\r\nspark.range(1000000).selectExpr(\"COUNT(DISTINCT id DIV 2) as d2\", \"percentile_approx(id, array(0.0, 0.5, 0.9, 0.99, 1.0))\").show(false)\r\n```\r\n\r\nLike 88,561ms  to compute this.\r\n\r\nWhen I do percentile_approx on it's own it finishes in 223 ms.\r\n\r\nThe CPU takes 751 ms to do the distinct with the percentile_approx and 211 to do the percentile approx by itself. To be clear I don't expect us to win against the CPU. I also don't think this is a super high priority because I don't think that people are really going to combine these two together. But at the same time it is really really slow.\r\n",
