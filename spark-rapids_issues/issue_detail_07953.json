This is to add the following metrics, if we think that would be good to have.\r\n\r\nHow much time was lost from retrying. This will require some new APIs to say when a retry section starts and when it ends, but these are APIs we are interested in for other experiments anyways.\r\n\r\nNot sure if this should be on by default or if we want to do something like with the SQL metrics and enable it only if they are set to DEBUG.",
