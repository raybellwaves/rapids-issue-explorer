Right now it assumes that the cardinality of the input is going to directly impact the size of the output data.  generally that is correct, but for some operations, like collect_set and collect_list it is probably not true and we should adjust the heuristic to take that into account.\r\n\r\nThis is probably minor, but still it would be good to be more accurate and even better if we could skip the distinct_count entirely if we know that none of the aggs being done are going to impact the output size in a meaningful way (i.e. all collect_list aggs)\r\n",
