Please describe.**\r\nRight now if we have a conditional filter for an inner join that does not work in AST we fall back to doing a post filter on the join. But this might not be ideal if we could do part of the filter in AST. We should explore splitting the condition part of a join on AND conditions and see which if any of those conditions we can put into AST so we don't materialize the results, and which conditions we should fall back to doing a post filter on.\r\n",
