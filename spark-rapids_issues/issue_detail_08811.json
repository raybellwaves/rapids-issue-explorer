This is fine but it does not exercise many different aspects of scale. Like how many aggregations can we do in a single operation before things start to fall over.\r\n\r\nThis is an epic to come up with a set of scripts that will let us start to test the RAPIDs not just for larger amount of data, but also for more and more complex operations.  The first part of creating a data gen script for integration tests is done, but there are is a lot more work to do to finish this.\r\n\r\n   * [x] https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/8813\r\n   * [ ] https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/8724\r\n   * [x] https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/8814\r\n   * [ ] https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/8815\r\n   * [x] https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/8816\r\n   * [ ] https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/8817\r\n   * [ ] https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/8818\r\n   * [ ] I will leave kubernetes scale testing support for a later time.",
