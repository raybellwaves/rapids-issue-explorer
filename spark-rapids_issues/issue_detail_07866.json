    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nhttps://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/pull/7864 provides basic retry functionality for project. This is great, but it does not allow for splitting the input. This was not done because splitting the input requires an API change where multiple output batches could be created. This is simplest to implement in terms of an Interator that wraps another Iterator that it reads from. This should be simple enough to integrate with GpuProjectExec, but it gets to be more complicated for other places where a project or filter are used.  We don't have to update every place with these code changes, but it would be good to file follow on issues to look for more places we can/should update after this is done.\r\n\r\nTo be clear this is primarily to update GpuProjectExec to be able to do a split on the retry and to put changes in place that would allow others code paths to also do the same.",
