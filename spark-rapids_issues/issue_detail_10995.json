    "body": "In some `TimeZoneAwareExpression` that plugin supports only UTC, the expression will fallback according to `GpuOverrides.isUTCTimezone`. In some case like when we call an expression directly by passing a timezone as it's parameter, like in Spark UT:\r\n```scala\r\ncheckEvaluation(\r\n      StructsToJson(Map.empty, struct, Option(PST.getId)),\r\n      \"\"\"{\"t\":\"2015-12-31T16:00:00.000-08:00\"}\"\"\"\r\n    )\r\n```\r\nThe fallback doesn't work because it didn't change any configuration.\r\n\r\nFor expressions that support timezone, we will check the `expr.zoneId` in `BaseExprMeta.getZoneId()`, I hope we can use it instead of reading config when checking UTC timezone too.\r\n",
