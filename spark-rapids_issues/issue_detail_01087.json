    "body": "#1086 is in, but we can do better.  One of the big things I have noticed is that the pytest-xdist scheduler tries to keep the queue for each process filled. If we have long running tests at the end, this can result in a process with lots of things in its queue that can cause skew.  I have found that if we put the long running tests closer to the beginning of the run we can drop the total test time by a min or more locally.",
