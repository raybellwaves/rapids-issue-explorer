Yesterday we merged support for all three of those into our code base, so one branch and jar can support all three.\r\n\r\nFor the premerge build, it would be really nice if we had a way to run the unit and integration tests in parallel across the spark versions so we don\u2019t extend the time of that greatly.\r\n\r\nWe should look into our options to see what we can do.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nOne option mentioned by Calvin:\r\nJenkinsfile supports parallel stages so all three variants can run concurrently as long as there are enough slaves for it. If all the slaves are busy then the stages will be queued and run when the resources are available.\u201d\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n",
