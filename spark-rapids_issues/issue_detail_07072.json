I guess it would be nice to know that for the other things we parsed as well. like was this something we really didn't support vs we just haven't implemented the parsing of in the tool yet.  I'm fine with doing this separately to get this change in but can you file an issue for it?\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @tgravescs in https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/pull/7071#discussion_r1023068351_\r\n      ",
