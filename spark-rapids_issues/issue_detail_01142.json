    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nOnce https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/pull/1113 is merged, we support a small number of date/time formats on GPU in `unix_timestamp` / `to_unix_timestamp` based on a list of supported formats.\r\n\r\nIt would be better to add logic to determine if a format is supported so that we can support a wider range of formats. For example, we know that we can't currently support `.SSS` on GPU because cuDF and Spark have different support for variable number of milliseconds. There may be other cases like this.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nDetemine whether a format is supported based on the invidial parts of the format.\r\n\r\n",
