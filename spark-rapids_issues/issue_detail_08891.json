Please describe.**\r\nAs part of our efforts to limit host memory in the plugin `GpuRowBasedUserDefinedFunction` is one that is really hard to get right. We probably could do something with the changes we plan to put in place for C2R https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/8886 and R2C https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/8887 but the benefit is really not worth the added work. It was an interesting idea when we first started to look at it, but there really are no performance wins we have ever seen.",
