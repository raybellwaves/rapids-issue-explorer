This is not supported by #7580, and this support would either need to be added to the GPU version or we would need to fall back to the CPU if we can detect this feature is being requested (appears to be tied to `spark.databricks.delta.write.txnAppId` and `spark.databricks.delta.write.txnVersion`).\r\n\r\nNote that supporting this for 2.0.2 would likely require either a shim within 2.0.x support or more replication of Delta Lake code since `hasBeenExecuted` and other methods do not appear in Delta Lake 2.0.1 and earlier.",
