    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nThis is a follow on to #6831. In order to support all time zones we will need a way to be able to deal with repeating rules. These are the instances of `ZoneOffsetTransitionRule`. The idea is to that we would cache these on the CPU similar to what we do for `ZoneOffsetTransition`. However, we would need a lot more columns, because we would need to include the majority of the information included in the `ZoneOffsetTransitionRule`. Then we would need to recreate the same kind of logic that exists in `ZoneRules.getOffset`. But we have to be very careful. JDK code is under the a GPL license that makes it so you cannot copy it. Instead we are going to have to try and do a clean room implementation or we might be able to look at what joda time does, which is an Apache licensed library that also supports time zone conversions.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/JodaOrg/joda-time\r\n\r\nSpecifically https://github.com/JodaOrg/joda-time/blob/main/src/main/java/org/joda/time/tz/DateTimeZoneBuilder.java and https://github.com/JodaOrg/global-tz\r\n\r\nBut I am not sure everything lines up exactly the same so it could take a bit of work.\r\n\r\nAfter this we need to update the API that restricts which time zones we support so it includes all of them and deprecate it. Then we need to update all of the tests that have been written to check that we do not fall back and test the new time zones.",
