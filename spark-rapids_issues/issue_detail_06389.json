Please describe.**\r\nAfter https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids-jni/pull/496 we now have a kernel that can do a multiply that is compatible with Spark.  But that multiply may also involve doing up to two divide operations a few log10 operations and pow(10) operations on the GPU.  We really should look into optimizing all of that code to be more efficient and generally better tuned for the GPU.  So we can avoid things like diverging threads/etc.\r\n\r\nNote that there is likely to be some overlap with a new kernel to do a Spark compatible divide operation too. So we probably should wait for https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/6142 to be done before we dive into this.",
