    "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\nWhen I run NDS scale factor 200 with 4 concurrent on the GPU, 12 threads and 4 GiB of GPU memory (this is a stress test for reliability and retry) I am seeing some columns leaked.  All of the come from the ColaesceBatches iterator.  Specifically https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/blob/0b6dd14044b5d43f78c67b8aee480b78de46866f/sql-plugin/src/main/scala/com/nvidia/spark/rapids/GpuCoalesceBatches.scala#L748\r\n\r\nIt looks like we get the ColumnarBatch from the SpillableColumnarBatch correctly, but once it is returned it ends up being leaked. I think this only happens when an exception is thrown as a part of the processing. But I cannot tell where that exception is happening exactly. I don't think this is super critical right now, but we should take some time to debug it and provide a good way to debug retry exceptions when they happen, and possibly correlate them to retry blocks so we can see what exception might have caused a leak and what retry blocks it was in when different operations happened.\r\n",
