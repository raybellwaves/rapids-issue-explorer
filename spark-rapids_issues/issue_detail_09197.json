    "body": "While discussing #9160 it was noted that it would become difficult to determine the actual concurrent task setting from an eventlog, as it would be set per executor (and theoretically different if running in a heterogeneous GPU environment).  We could make it easier to diagnose executor-specific settings in an eventlog by emitting custom events.  We already register each executor with the driver in our executor plugin, and we could convey some extra information such as GPU type/size, concurrent tasks, or other startup information.  The custom message would not be shown by the Spark UI by default (since it's a custom event), but it would be present in the eventlog as a JSON entry and we could build/enhance tools to leverage it (e.g.: profiling tool).",
