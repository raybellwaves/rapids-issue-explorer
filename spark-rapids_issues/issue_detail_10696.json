Please describe.**\r\nNot 100% sure if this is a new feature or an audit issue.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/commit/5e42ecc8163 fixed some issues that allows Spark to write ORC file with brotli compression.\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-44115 is what updated Spark to use a new version of ORC that supports this type of compression that also went into 4.0.0\r\n\r\nSo that means in theory we could start to see Brotli compressed ORC files show up that we might need to read (not just write).\r\n\r\nI think our write checks will do the correct thing, and we are likely to crash if we see a file like this, instead of corrupting the data. But I wanted to file an issue just in case we think it will be important to do. Especially because we will probably need some lead time to support this with changes needed for CUDF too.\r\n\r\nAt a minimum we need to document that we do not support this.",
