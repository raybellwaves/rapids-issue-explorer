For those we fallback to the CPU as its more efficient. We should look into running those on the GPU.\r\n\r\nThere are multiple different things that happen:\r\n\r\nCheckpoint file (parquet)\r\n1) parquet file reads\r\n2) Delta Table Checkpoint with Stats #117282 - s3://.../_delta_log [34] [Cached]\r\nmap at StateCache.scala:55, I thought this was run as a UDF, needs investigation\r\n\r\njson files:\r\n1) json file reas\r\n2) possibly UDF\r\n3)  we have seen objecthashaggregate in here as well\r\n4) UnionWithLocalData",
