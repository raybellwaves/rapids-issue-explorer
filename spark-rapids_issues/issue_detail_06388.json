    "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\nAfter https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/pull/6387 in ANSI mode we throw an ArithmeticException when we overflow on a multiply.  This is tested as a part of `test_multiplication_ansi_overflow` in the integration tests.  In Spark 3.3.0 this exception was changed to a SparkArithmeticException. There are other code paths in GpuDecimalMultiply that check for overflows, but in the common case they should never be executed so we can ignore them.",
