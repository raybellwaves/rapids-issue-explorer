It would be really great to be able to detect double frees in addition to leaks.\r\n\r\nI started to do a little of this in https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/pull/10158, but had to revert it because tests started to fail with lots of these double free errors. This is here to enable the double free checking and see what code is doing it and if there is something we need to fix.",
