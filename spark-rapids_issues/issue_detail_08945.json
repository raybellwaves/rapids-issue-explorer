Please describe.**\r\nhttps://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/pull/8944 has to work around an issue because TieredProject could not preserve scalar values between different tiers.  In practice to make this work we need to be able to spill scalar values (or something very similar to doing that), and we need to update tiered project to call columnarEvalAny and try to preserve what was returned in a spillable way.\r\n\r\nThis is mostly for ScalarSubquery because other cases should generally be covered by constant folding.",
