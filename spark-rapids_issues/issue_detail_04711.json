Please describe.**\r\nWe currently have some ways to support MIG on YARN using docker and cgroups but some users may not want to use docker. Look into supporting it with just cgroups.\r\n\r\nit does appear that MIG should work with cgroups and map in the ci/gi devices and cuda should recognize it as the device 0. This however would require modifications to YARN because the current cgroup code there just maps in the whole GPU device.",
