    "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\nWe know that there are some issues in CUDF with parsing empty lines. We first tried to fix this by passing in an empty dictionary as a place holder '{}' but this caused other problems because CUDF is not happy to produce a table with no columns in it. Or perhaps more accurately some of our code is not happy with that. We worked around this by adding in a column that was requested and setting it to null. That works for empty lines, but it shows up as a problem if all of the lines are `{}`, `[]`, or all of them have something in them, but it is invalid.\r\n\r\nWe really should just fix the underlying problem instead of trying to work around it.  This also exists in ScanJson, but I have not formally added a test for it yet.",
