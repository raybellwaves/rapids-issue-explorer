    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n`round` does `HALF_UP` rounding `bround` does `HALF_EVEN` rounding and `format_number` does `HALF_EVEN` rounding but goes through a different code path from bround to do it on the CPU.\r\n\r\nI recently found some bugs with rounding in CUDF for very large decimal values. I then decided to check a little deeper with doubles and I think I have found some more issues there that we need to decide what we want to do about. I'll file a separate issue for that when I know more.\r\n\r\nMy manual tests found these problems kind of by luck.\r\n\r\n```\r\nspark.range(100000000L).selectExpr(\"*\", s\"1 / id as div_num\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nand then round the numbers to various decimal places.  This works, but it is not that exhaustive. It might be good enough for a lot of cases, but I think we should try and either turn something like this into a more formal set of tests.\r\n\r\nI have seen a few places where we can get errors. Because this is rounding they all revolve around a 5 in the digit just after the one we are rounding to. And I often see them with a 2 in the digit just above it. Things like 125 or 625 are very common numbers I see. I think this is because floating point has a hard time representing these numbers and we can get off.\r\n\r\nThe second set of things that I have seen a lot of issues with is for rounding to very large decimal places, like 28 decimal places/etc. We should make sure that we have tests that cover all of these cases.",
