Not sure if there are others in JSON or not. Also not sure what happens if CUDF if others are encountered vs in Spark.\r\n\r\nWe need to figure out the set of characters which should be supported.\r\n\r\nBecause of how cuda works it is very rare for CUDF to return an error if it sees an escape it does not understand. We are likely just going to have to document the differences.",
