    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nCurrently when we process a broadcast hash join, each task rebuilds the hash table used for the join.  This is wasteful, since the broadcast data is the same across all tasks and thus the hash table is the same across all tasks.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nIn order to cache the hash table, we need to make it spillable memory. Spilling a cudf hash table is a bit problematic because it's opaque --  we don't know how to serialize it.  However we can still cache it with some help from the spill framework.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if the spill framework supported the concept of a \"recompute-no-spill\" buffer, meaning a buffer of memory that we do not spill but can recompute its contents on-demand.  If we need to free some GPU memory, we simply free these types of buffers, and clients trying to reacquire the buffer will trigger a recompute of the hash table since it has been freed since it was last acquired.",
