Please describe.**\r\nThere are a few operations that we support today that change values in the operations, but are time zone aware.\r\n\r\n* [ ] GpuSequence - this might just be something that we ignore because we don't support the timestamp/date versions of this. If that is true then we want to be sure that it runs on the GPU even if it is for non-date/time types no matter what the time zone is.\r\n* [ ] GpuDateAddInterval - this one adds a literal calendar interval to a date. Not 100% sure right now how this is impact by the time zone unless it has something to do with months, which we do not currently support.\r\n\r\nThis might just end up being testing that these work in all time zones and updating them correctly to not fall back to the CPU in those cases.\r\n\r\n",
