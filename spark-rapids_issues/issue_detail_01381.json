Please describe.**\r\nIn datetimeExpressions.scala we currently have a list of datetime patterns that we support, which is by no means complete. It will be quite a lot of work listing all the possible combinations of patterns we support\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nWe should instead list patterns that we don't currently support, or even better would be to change the DateUtils.scala, which already has the framework in-place to do so\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nNA\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nNA\r\n",
