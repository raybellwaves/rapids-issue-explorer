We have been using a CUDF kernel that uses formats that are compatible with python/C++. But the java formats are very different, so we have to do a mapping. But there are java formats that are not ambiguous until they are mapped into the format the cudf supports.  We really should just write our own kernel that tries to do what Spark/Java does directly.",
