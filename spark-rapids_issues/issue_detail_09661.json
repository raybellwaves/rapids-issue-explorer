    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nThere're some improvements we can make for AST rewrite.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Support conditional equi-joins with non-AST, \r\n   - [ ] broadcast hash join rewrite https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/9759\r\n- [ ] Bump up cudf version and update plugin accordingly to support latest AST features. This includes: https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/8157 and https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/9645)\r\n- [ ] Fallback message improvement: it's hardly to tell the actually fallback reason in GpuOverrides warning message.\r\nFrom `spark.time(left.join(right, length(col(\"leftstr\")) + length(col(\"rightstr\")) >= left(\"id\") + right(\"id\"), joinType=\"leftouter\").count())`, it reports following message:\r\n```\r\n          !Expression <Cast> cast((length(leftstr#301) + length(rightstr#296)) as bigint) cannot run on GPU because AST is required and this expression does not support AST\r\n              @Expression <Add> (length(leftstr#301) + length(rightstr#296)) could run on GPU\r\n                !Expression <Length> length(leftstr#301) cannot run on GPU because AST is required and this expression does not support AST\r\n                  !Expression <AttributeReference> leftstr#301 cannot run on GPU because AST is required and expression AttributeReference leftstr#301 produces an unsupported type StringType\r\n                !Expression <Length> length(rightstr#296) cannot run on GPU because AST is required and this expression does not support AST\r\n                  !Expression <AttributeReference> rightstr#296 cannot run on GPU because AST is required and expression AttributeReference rightstr#296 produces an unsupported type StringType\r\n```\r\nIt's more straightforward to AST failure reason results from 1) AST not supported by cast; 2) Failed to rewrite AST condition since contains cross childern attributes. Other message can share the same reason (e.g., cannot run on GPU because cast in this case).\r\n- [ ] Update AST join split condition code to avoid idempotent issues https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/9680\r\n- [ ] Java AST String literal does not provide a desired encoding  https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/14397\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nExtract non AST-able condition and push down to child nodes for conditional equal equal.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nMore feature coverage in Cudf. But it needs more time and some cases are not likely to be implemented.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThis is a tracking issue for some follow-ups of https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/pull/9635 which introduced the AST basic framework and related support on BroadcastNestedLoopJoin.\r\n\r\n",
