We know that ML uses the regularly and they can easily be translated to/from SQL types.\r\n\r\nSo it really would end up looking like. Extract the SQL type from it using `sqlType`. And generate that. I am not 100% sure what the type conversion looks like form an expression in these cases. If we need to convert it to the backing object we can do that by calling serialize on it.\r\n",
