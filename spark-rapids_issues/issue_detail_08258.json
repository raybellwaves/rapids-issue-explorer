We also don't fully have support for split and retry everywhere.  This is to go through all of the code for the various operators to find If the code allocated GPU memory \r\n\r\n1. is that allocation covered by the retry framework\r\n2. if so does the retry code support a split and retry\r\n3. If there is no split and retry coverage would the algorithms support this (Some algorithms inherently cannot without a substantial change to how the algorithms work).\r\n\r\nThen once we have all of this information we can file follow on issues to cover anything that was missed.\r\n\r\nNOTE that all expressions should already be covered (at least everything except for Random with is the only non-deterministic expression that we support)",
