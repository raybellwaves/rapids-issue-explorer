    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nI recently was working on a query that was doing a distinct on several columns including one that is an array and it is also a child column of a struct. We could not support the array as a grouping key on the GPU yet. So, I wanted to see what the performance would be if we didn't include that column in the distinct, but the performance got to be 3x worse. On further investigation it turned out that there is a \"IS NOT NULL\" clause for this nested sub column which was causing it to still be read, but because it was not a part of the grouping aggregation it looks like the NestedColumnAliasing optimization rule did not kick in and we read in all of the parent struct. This was much more data than before (101.8 GiB of decompressed data instead of 38.2 GiB). \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nWe should look at the NestedColumnAliasing optimization rule and understand why it didn't apply in this particular case, then go back and propose a fix to Spark.",
