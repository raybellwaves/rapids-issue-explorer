Please describe.**\r\n\r\nThis issue is from:  https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/pull/7172#discussion_r1036170523\r\nAlluxio has hundreds of metrics, refer to https://docs.alluxio.io/os/user/stable/en/reference/Metrics-List.html.\r\nSome of them are useful for monitoring performance.\r\n\r\nI already got some experience, but it's not enough:\r\n```\r\nMaster.TotalPaths: \r\nThe total number of files and directories in the Alluxio namespace.\r\nIf this is large, the Alluxio master server will consume more memories.\r\n\r\nMaster.TotalRpcs: \r\nThroughput of master RPC calls. This metric indicates how busy the master is serving the client and worker requests\r\nThis metric can be used to identify if the Alluxio master is running slowly.\r\nNote: For the task-time replacement algorithm, there are no RPCs.\r\n\r\nMaster.JournalFlushTimer: \r\nThe timer statistics of the journal flush\r\nIf IO is a bottleneck, the value will be high.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI tried the cluster with 1 `g4dn.xlarge` node for driver and 3 `g4dn.xlarge` for workers, but can't reproduce the high CPU utilization.\r\n\r\nI enabled the CSV sinks with a 5s flush period, and the IO utilization is not high.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it's because the file number is small in the NDS data source.\r\n\r\nNeed more investigations to find some useful metrics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
