    "body": "`spark.rapids.sql.explain` is a useful feature for spark-rapids developers (especially when set to `ALL`) and for advanced users. \r\n\r\nThis feature logs at the WARN level to the Driver. By default it also takes `NOT_ON_GPU` out of the overall context `ALL`, whereas `ALL` most likely shows that many / most operations are on GPU as expected. \r\n\r\nFor new users it is confusing, exacerbated when it shows *unsupportable* operations like DDL not on GPU without explanation. If the operation is unsupportable there is no user action that could improve the query execution plan. The only action left is to turn off the explain, which will also loses helpful diagnostics for otherwise supportable plans. \r\n\r\nIn addition, there are SparkPlan nodes  where there is no simple clear-cut criteria for quickly determining supportability of  an individual operation.\r\n\r\nTherefore this epic tracks the following general avenues of improvements:\r\n- Reduce the number of confusing `NOT_ON_GPU` explains akin to #9205 \r\n- Develop a mechanism to produce \r\n  - a dedicated standalone log, and \r\n  - a dedicated event log event that contains `ALL` diagnostic information \r\n\r\nwithout scaring  the user with WARN messages on the Driver log",
