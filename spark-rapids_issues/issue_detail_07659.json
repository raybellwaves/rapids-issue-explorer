Please describe.**\r\nTo be able to compare different RMM backends including spill/etc. It would be great to track metrics like time taken to allocate, time taken to free, total bytes ever allocated, total bytes ever freed, number of allocation operations, number of free operations. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nIt would be great to have this as an option to add into the RMM stack. If possible adding some metrics into the spark plugin at the executor level to let us poll this information and reset it if needed.",
