If there are many input batches and the aggregation merges are efficient in terms of row-count reduction, some spills could be avoided by merging batch aggregations when the total cached size approaches some configured limit (e.g.: the target merge batch size as already computed) rather than waiting until all input batches have been aggregated.",
