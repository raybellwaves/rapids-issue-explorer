There is a pending cuDF PR (rapidsai/cudf/pull/11099) which might fix this. If this is merged, then we should re-enable word boundaries in fuzz tests and test this scenario. \r\n\r\n**Steps/Code to reproduce bug**\r\nUse `\\B` or `\\b` as the regular expression, and pass input that only contains Unicode characters. cuDF currently cannot recognize words constructed from Unicode and when using `regexp_replace`, this manifests in an incorrect replacement. \r\n\r\n",
