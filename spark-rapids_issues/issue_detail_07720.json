Please describe.**\r\nin https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/7688 we fixed a bug dealing with ignoreMissingFiles and the combining reader. It isn't completely obviously how all the cases get handled because we return a null schema when we hit the ignoreMissingFiles due to the way the API is designed and we don't have access to the read schema.\r\n\r\nWe should look at refactoring the API to ideally not return a null readschema.  We could either make schema available there, which gets more complicated with iceberg, or it might be better to see if that API could return an Option and return None in the case that happens.  \r\n\r\nwe should check all the various reader types to make sure they are handling",
