This is likely too wide a synchronize and we should benchmark this better against cuda events.\r\n\r\nWith a cuda event we could record at the time when a buffer becomes spillable. We would then synchronize on the event referenced by the RapidsBuffer before we call free on it in the spill thread. I expect 1 event per stream may be a good starting point, where we would synchronize against the streams that produced spill framework actions, but not have to lock down the whole gpu during spill.",
