This can result in problems where we don't know what to allow to run on the CPU without errors. Ideally what we want is a way to verify that these particular operators did run on the GPU.  But that is hard to do when there are multiple queries running because of delta lake.  For now on the zorder tests I just disable the check, which is not good.",
