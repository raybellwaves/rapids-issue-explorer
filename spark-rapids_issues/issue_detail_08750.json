    "body": "When `GpuSubstringIndex`, cudf didn't have support for something like this. We filed https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/5158 and it got implemented in cuDF a long time ago, but we haven't gone back to `GpuSubstringIndex` and used the new api :(\r\n\r\nThe current implementation in the plugin relies on a regular expression that takes into account `delim` and `count`, but it doesn't work for delimiters that are multi character for example, and we throw in this case (which is good). That said, it would be great to move to the cuDF version of this.\r\n\r\nNote that we need to make sure have unit and integration tests for this, especially showing that we could support multi character delimiters after the change to `cudf::slice_strings`.",
