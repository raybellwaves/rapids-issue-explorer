Please describe.**\r\nCudf supports only strf patterns while spark supports Java date/time patterns defined in SimpleDateFormat as of Spark 3.0. We have a utility function in DateUtils that converts a Java date/time pattern literal to strf pattern. We need a way to support patterns that are vectors\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nIt may be possible for us to write a unary transform to convert a Java date/time vector to a strf pattern vector\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nCurrently there are no viable alternatives, unless cudf decides to support Java patterns. \r\n",
