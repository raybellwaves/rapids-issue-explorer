    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nSometimes the RAPIDS Accelerator crashes when running a particular job in environments where getting logs is a challenge. Spark logs are tremendously verbose and can be useful when debugging in real time, but are not always fully enabled in production environments due to storage demands or performance. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nIt would be nice for when a Spark application crashes when running the plugin, the crash \"state\" (the exception backtrace, diagnostic information, etc.) should be saved in a configured location to actually be able to get at least an initial sense of what went wrong. This goes towards making the plugin more enterprise-y.  This location can be configured using Spark configuration, and can be either a JSON file containing all of the information needed, or a directory of files that could be useful.\r\n\r\n",
