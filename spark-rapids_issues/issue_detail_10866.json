The corresponding downstream PR such as  https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/pull/10833 updates the sha part of spark-rapids-jni to pick up the spark-rapids-jni with the necessary upstream API changes. It is able to pass the pre-merge and gets in.\r\n\r\nWhile this is happening unrelated dev work can proceed without seeing disruptions and having to do manual pining locally\r\n",
