The test relies on the RapidsBufferCatalog being initialized, and this isn't at all clear in the tests. \r\n\r\nThis task is to provide a trait or superclass we can use to initialize the catalog consistently everywhere in the unit tests. A test that would touch the catalog should use it. The trait should make sure to shut down the catalog afterwards, so any tests that were piggy backing from a prior initialization will start failing, and we can fix.",
