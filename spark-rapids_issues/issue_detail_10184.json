    "body": "The reason OOM injection works with CI is that we inject OOM in those places that can handle it (they have a `withRetry`). Recently, we added the ability to inject a \"split and retry\", however, we are not triggering these exceptions when inside of a `withRetry` that has a split function defined, instead we inject these for all `withRetry` flavors, which I don't think is what we want.\r\n\r\nI would like to change the  injection mechanism for split and retry so we make sure we don't inject if our scope isn't ready for it.",
