Please describe.**\r\n\r\nI filed https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/10834 because the link check failures were so common people were ignoring them.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/pull/10872 was put up to ignore all links from the checker that are release jars in sonatype.\r\n\r\nThat is not a good long term solution. It is us putting on blinders to not look at something that is actually wrong/broken.  We don't want to have docs in the default branch of our github repo that point to unreleased jars. We need to update our process so that we can stage docs in a way so we are ready for a release, but they do not show up on the default branch where users might try to click on them until we are actually doing the release.",
