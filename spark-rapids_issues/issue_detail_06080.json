However, these tests are not yet set up for the nightly testing environment.  Regular expressions are disabled on the GPU when UTF-8 is not available in the JVM environment.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nWe should have nightly CI coverage for all regular expression testing (including fallback for when UTF-8 is not available).\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nSee https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/pull/6041 and https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/pull/5776 as well as related issue https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/5629\r\n",
