Please describe.**\r\nWith so many different operators and expressions supported on the GPU and so many configuration settings and optional features (AQE, UCX, etc) it is not feasible to cover all combinations in unit and integration tests and we sometimes hit combinations that do not work as expected.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI would like us to have a query fuzzing utility that can generate random configurations, random data, and random query plans and compare results between regular Spark and Spark on GPU.\r\n\r\nDatabricks wrote a paper about their approach to fuzzing with Spark and this is good background reading.\r\n\r\nhttps://bogdanghit.github.io/publications/sparkfuzz.pdf\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nNone\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nI created a minimal demo which was discussed in https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/pull/2952 and which can be used as the basis for this work",
