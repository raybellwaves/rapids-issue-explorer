Please describe.**\r\nlibcudf supports sort hints for the input data to indicate whether the data is already sorted on the grouping keys, but the plugin always indicates the inputs are not sorted.  This could cause libcudf to implement a suboptimal solution where it redundantly sorts the input for cases where it needs a sort-based grouping approach.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nThe plugin should use the ordering stats already available in the Spark plan to convey to cudf whether or not the data is already sorted by a grouping key before performing a group by aggregation.\r\n",
