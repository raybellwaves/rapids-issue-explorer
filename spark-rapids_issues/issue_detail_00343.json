    "body": "In general terms, we implement Spark execs (like join) in the gpu, and there could be caveats. Say at some point we don't support `RightJoin`, or at some point input with `NaN`'s is not supported. It seems this can be easily handled using an annotation at the exec level that describes (in simple terms) what the caveat should be, so we can pick it up into `configs.md` or some other page.\r\n\r\nHere's an example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@GpuExpressionDescrition(\r\n   gpuCaveat=\"doesn't implement feature X\")\r\ncase class MyExec()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen we can call `getAnnotation` in the class to get this data back, like the `FunctionRegistry` does.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we can also move the override description to this annotation as well, and add a `gpuSupportedType` property to enumerate supported types.",
