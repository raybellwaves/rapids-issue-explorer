We refectored the code a while ago and removed that. Just the fact that it works for testing means that the refactor was correct and I think we can just delete the check entirely.\r\n\r\nDetails explained at https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/pull/10851/files/7237cb601ff9e8097deab6e95c968f6cb4c863a7#r1608257029",
