I tried to do this, but my implementation had some bugs in it and the integration tests did not catch them. It appears that the ByteBuffer path is only used in some situations so we need to\r\n\r\n1) Understand what the situations are so we can write tests to cover that path\r\n2) Write those tests\r\n3) See if we can do the optimization suggested and not go through an Array to move the data from one a HostMemoryBuffer to a ByteBuffer.",
