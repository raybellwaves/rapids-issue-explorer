    "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\nIn Spark if the JSON is not valid, then nothing from that document/row is parsed and all values are returned as null. CUDF validates some JSON, but not all of it the way that SPARK wants. So things like leading zeros on numbers can optionally invalidate an entire row. We will need CUDFs help to fully support config options like `allowNumericLeadingZeros`, `allowNonNumericNumbers`, `allowBackslashEscapingAnyCharacter`, and `allowUnquotedControlChars`.  All of these we kind of need in some form or another depending on the JSON operator.\r\n",
