In GpuHashAggregate if the intermediate values get to be too large we end up sorting the intermediate results and then doing a final pass to output the answer.\r\n\r\nIn many cases it might be good to have a heuristic in place that sees if the output got smaller so we can decide if we do https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/7404 instead.  But in the cases when we see the output is getting a lot smaller than the input or if it is not a partial aggregate, we probably should look at doing hash partitioning of the intermediate results instead of sorting the result.",
