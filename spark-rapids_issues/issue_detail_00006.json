Please describe.**\r\nwhen parsing CSV currently the CPU will read through the data using the HadoopFileLinesReader and replace the line endings. It would be great from a performance standpoint to do a block copy of most of the data, and skip the line ending translation.  This would require that the cudf CSV reader support  line endings that are '\\r', '\\n', or '\\r\\n'.  This is not a simple task but could reduce the CPU utilization significantly.",
