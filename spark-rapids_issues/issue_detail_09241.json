However, if we change the seed to other values, some cases will fail. \r\n\r\nI wish we could improve the integration tests to avoid this, e.g. use a dynamic seed for each run, or test with more data for those cases that are easy to fail.\r\n\r\nSome failed cases:\r\n\r\n- [x] #9242\r\n- [x] #9243\r\n- [x] #9244\r\n- [x] #9245\r\n- [x] #9246\r\n- [ ] #9247\r\n\r\nWe should fix them or mark them as XFAIL first.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nSet random seeds for each test run and log the seed for reproducibility.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nOr we can make the easy to fail cases stronger, e.g. more data for aggregate tests and tests with long generated strings, more precise data range for fallback/exception tests.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nSome similar issues that has been fixed: #8716 and #8607\r\n",
