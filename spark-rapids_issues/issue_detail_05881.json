Please describe.**\r\nIt would be nice to have a script or tool that validated that a spark application got the resources that you requested. For instance, I might request 8 executors but depending on the cluster manager you might not get 8... ie on YARN or standalone it might not have enough resources if you don't take the totals into account.  with dynamic allocation on you could get different then you expect, etc.\r\n\r\nThis would be useful for benchmark runs.\r\n\r\nit would be nice if it dumped out configurations like memory and core per executor as well.
