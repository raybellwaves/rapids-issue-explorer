    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nThe current `GpuRand` will do the random number generation on the CPU using the same code as the CPU to match exactly what it is doing.  But this is very slow, so when it is used, like with zordering, we can run into situations where it is a bottleneck.  thrust now supports random number generation on the GPU using a number of different algorithms. https://thrust.github.io/doc/group__random.html \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nWe should look into creating a `GpuRand` implementation that is based off of the thrust technology and see if we can either have a config that lets us use the faster version, or if there is a way to replicate the XOrShift random number generation exactly.",
