There are lots and lots of different options for parsing values, escaping characters and configuring delimiters. Because of this complexity we should develop a fuzz testing framework to be able to verify that our code behaves the same as Spark on the CPU.  We should concentrate on the default settings.\r\n\r\nformat: UTF-8\r\ndelimiter: `,`\r\nquote: `\"`\r\nescape: `\\`\r\nlineSeparator: (not set so it is `\\r|\\n|\\r\\n`)\r\ncharToEscapeQuoteEscaping: not set\r\ncomment: `\\u0000` (aka not set)\r\nignoreLeadingWhiteSpace: false\r\nignoreTrailingWhiteSpace: false\r\nemptyValue: (empty string)\r\nunescapedQuoteHandling: `STOP_AT_DELIMITER`\r\n\r\nAnd a schema is also provided.\r\n\r\nIt would be great to expand this out further in the future, but for now this is the most important.
