    "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\nI am not 100% sure why this is happening, but it appears that when we do a range partition we copy all of the columns for a sampled row instead of copying just the columns that we are sorting/partitioning on. In most cases this is a tiny amount of data so no one should care, but if some of the other columns include large arrays or strings it can result it a lot of data being copied when it should not be.\r\n\r\n**Steps/Code to reproduce bug**\r\nRead in any data that has more than one column. Sort on just one of the columns.  The RangePartitioner will include the other columns in the partitions.  It looks to be related with how I wrote the `GpuSorter`. Sorry about that.",
