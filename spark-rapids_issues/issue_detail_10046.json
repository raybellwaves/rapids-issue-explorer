The hard part is making sure that we can roll back any of the caching.\r\nWe can calculate/get the `inputRowCount`, `noMoreInput` and `numUnprocessedInCache` without needing to get the input batch from inputCbSpillable so that might make it simpler to add in the retry logic.\r\n\r\nThe iterator logic should use `withRetry` to ensure that the cache doesn't get trashed on failures.",
