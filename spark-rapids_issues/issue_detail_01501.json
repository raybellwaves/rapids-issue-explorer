    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n#1489 added in support for the `array` sql function.  The problem with this is that it could easily result in hitting cudf limitations, especially when nested types are supported #1500. There is no good way to have an expression work around this problem right now.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI see three possibilities.\r\n  1. cudf fixes it for us, either by support for chunked columns like arrow, or an 64-bit index.\r\n  2. We change our abstractions and simulate chunked columns ourselves, which is not going to be all that nice.\r\n  3. We implement some kind of an API where we can ask a GPU expression if they need to split up the data before processing and then have a special API that would handle doing all of that for us.\r\n\r\nI think the last option is the only reasonable one in the short term, if it becomes an issue with customers.",
