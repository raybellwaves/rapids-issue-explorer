New columns should have nulls in the old partitions.\r\n  - [x] Old partitions created before columns are added in the middle of the table. New columns should have nulls in the old partitions. (Not supported by Spark V1 datasource)\r\n  - [x] Old partitions created before columns are dropped at the end of the table. New columns should have nulls in the old partitions. (Not suported by Spark V1 datasource)\r\n  - [x] Old partitions created before columns are dropped in the middle of the table. New columns should have nulls in the old partitions.

New columns should have nulls in the old partitions. (Not supported by Spark V1 datasource)\r\n- [x] #8797 SPARK-5309: ORC STRING column uses dictionary compression. OrcQuerySuite.scala#359.
