Please describe.**\r\nhttps://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/pull/8706 adds in a tool to generate lots of different data types, but I skipped a number of common ones that Spark supports.\r\n\r\n * [ ] BinaryType\r\n * [ ] CalendarIntervalType\r\n * [ ] CharType (Really the same as StringType, but it includes a length. Spark might complain because I think it is always translated to StringType, but we should test it)\r\n * [x] MapType (We need to worry a little about duplicate keys, but I don't think we should worry about generating them, just fix it up before we put it in the Spark data structure that needs to be returned)\r\n * [ ] NullType\r\n * [ ] VarcharType (Very similar to CharType, but not fixed length)\r\n",
