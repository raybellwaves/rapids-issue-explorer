    "body": "There are many places where we filter for nulls often because Spark explicitly introduces this into the plan after a scan.  Currently this null filter involves a project of the IsNotNull predicate function and a filter, but we can avoid the manifestation of the predicate column and the filter call in the common case where there are no nulls by simply checking `.hasNulls` on the key columns.  This would be similar to the no-op null filtering optimization in GpuHashJoin.filterNulls but generalized to the predicate appearing in a projection list.",
