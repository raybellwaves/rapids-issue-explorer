We should be able to examine the overhead memory amount, and WARN or outright fail, when the amount of off-heap memory we know we could request doesn't fit in the overhead memory specified.\r\n\r\nWe would need to pay attention to each scheduler we support as they may handle overhead differently (than yarn). If we cannot reliably detect the overhead that would be enforced, at least we could log the amount of memory we expect to be available. \r\n\r\nNot all host memory is handled by the pools, as we will direct allocate memory from the host if need be. We should take into account a swag of the maximum memory we'd expect a task to allocate on the host, or propose how this part should be handled.",
