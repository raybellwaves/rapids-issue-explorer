We should begin testing it, following suit from the UCX-py guys: https://github.com/rapidsai/ucx-py/issues/992\r\n\r\n- We should turn on UCX in our performance cluster to make sure RDMA continues to work. We should verify RoCE via wireshark.\r\n- We should also try UCX in an NVLinked environment (DGX) to make sure that it can use NVLink successfuly, and see all NICs in that case.",
