Please describe.**\r\nAfter seeing the big performance gains from https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/pull/8441 I did a quick profile run of a subset of the tests and I found that even after the caching fix data generation is taking a majority of the time, when we are not waiting for Spark.  And of this almost all of it is in `sre_yield` which is the tool we use to do string generation.  (we also use it to generate strings that are formatted like proper decimal values).  It would be good to see what we can do to speed up this string generation.  Perhaps we can look at a good way to generate random strings without it if there is no regular expression passed in.  We might also want to look at alternatives for generating decimal values, or very simple patterns.",
