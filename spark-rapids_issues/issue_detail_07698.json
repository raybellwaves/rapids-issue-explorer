    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nI filed https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/7485 to fix some potentially problematic cases with `biwiseMergeAndSetValidity`. Originally I wanted to stop using the API wherever possible, but the fix for the operator itself is not that bad, so we decided to go that route. But this is a really dangerous API and I just don't know if the performance savings using it outweigh the inherent danger in it.\r\n\r\nLike if the column that is passed in, which will have validity set for it, has nulls in it at all, this API can stomp over the top of it and make it not null. This can result in us using/reading bogus data.\r\n\r\nI still think we should try to stop using this API and run some performance tests to see what the impact is of moving away from it.",
