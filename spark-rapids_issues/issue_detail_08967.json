I know I wrote it :)\r\n\r\ncudaMallocAsync now has support for pinned memory pools. We should play around with it. See if it will work for our use cases, and if so, see if RMM would be good to use with it, or if it would be better to use access it directly. Also we would need to understand exactly when it is supported and when it is not so we can either fall back to the existing java implementation and also know if/when we can drop support for the java implementation totally.",
