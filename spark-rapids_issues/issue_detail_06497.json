    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nWhen using something like alluxio with S3 we kind of want characteristics of both multithreaded reader and coalescing depending on whether it has to read the data from s3 or from local disk. With Alluxio we default to use the coalescing reader, whihc meaning during cold reads from S3 the performance isn't as good as with multithreaded reader. During testing, I found that the filter blocks call in the coalescing reader can take a long time. So to help with that add an option to make that multithreaded.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/6496 implemented this for Parquet.  This issue is to implement it for ORC and the test of the readers that support the coalescing reader.",
