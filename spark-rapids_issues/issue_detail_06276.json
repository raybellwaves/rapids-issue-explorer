It might be good for us to try and play around with using these for things like with the coalesce expression or pattern matching for `if(isNull(a), b, a)` or something similar.  I have not seen too many of these types of operations show up in any traces, but it would be an interesting first step to start to explore the framework to do other types of replacements in the future.",
