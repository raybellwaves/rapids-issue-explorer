We need to ensure that these operations still work if the time zone is not UTC.\r\n\r\nLike `GpuHour` (#6834), this has already been implemented using existing cuDF base, we just need to ensure that during testing it still works with a non-UTC timezone. The timezone checks should allow this operation to stay on the GPU.  \r\n\r\n",
