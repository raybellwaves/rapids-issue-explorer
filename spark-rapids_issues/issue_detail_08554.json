    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nDeletion vectors are a storage optimization feature that can be enabled on Delta Lake tables. By default, when a single row in a data file is deleted, the entire Parquet file containing the record must be rewritten. With deletion vectors enabled for the table, some Delta operations use deletion vectors to mark existing rows as removed without rewriting the Parquet file. Subsequent reads on the table resolve current table state by applying the deletions noted by deletion vectors to the most recent table version.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nWe need to ensure that we respect deletion vectors in Delta Lake 2.3.0 and later when performing reads. We should also add support for writing deletion vectors when performing writes.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nNone\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nhttps://docs.delta.io/2.4.0/delta-deletion-vectors.html\r\n",
