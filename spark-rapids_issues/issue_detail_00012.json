It would be great if we could avoid going from an arrow compatible GPU format to the CPU, which we then convert into rows, and then back into an arrow format to send to python, and finally doing the reverse back.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nIt would be great to just go from GPU memory to the host and some small changes to make it be sent over to python.",
