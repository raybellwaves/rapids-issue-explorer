    "body": "The `GpuParquetScan` has an 8MB copy buffer allocation per reader instance.  \r\nhttps://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/blob/d7f58eacc42fe0154ee6eaaf1429ae5d22d21842/sql-plugin/src/main/scala/com/nvidia/spark/rapids/GpuParquetScan.scala#L1391\r\n\r\nThis might account for a significant portion of the executor's available memory, on setups with a high core count, and low heap allocation.\r\n\r\nFor instance, on machines with 128 cores, if the executor is set up with only 1GB of memory, then enabling the multi-file reader for Parquet could result in the entire 1GB of memory being consumed by the copy buffers across all threads.  This leads to failures such as in https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/9135.\r\n\r\nIt would be good to evaluate whether this 8MB allocation can be lowered if possible. Or at least, accounted for.",
