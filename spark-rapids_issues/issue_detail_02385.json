We should be able to add it back in, but it would require a few changes to make it efficient.\r\n\r\n1) We would want to be sure that we drop duplicate keys from the stream side instead of from the built side.  This avoids any issues with contiguous split and double spilling of data.\r\n2) We would have to be sure that the conditional is updated to find the columns that were removed in alternative locations.\r\n3) We would have to deal with falling back to a sort merge join in a clean way even after the keys have been split from the data.",
