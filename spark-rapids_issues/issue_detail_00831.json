Please describe.**\r\nIt can be tricky to make sure task code doesn't inadvertently pull in many more objects in a closure than intended, and this can lead to high task deserialization times.  Related to #773, we need a way to monitor task deserialization times on a regular basis and flag discrepancies for further investigation.\r\n \r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nAs part of regular benchmarking queries against the CPU, we should also gather the reported task deserialization metrics for both the CPU and GPU.  We can then compare these metrics across CPU and GPU runs for the same query and see if there's a large discrepancy.",
