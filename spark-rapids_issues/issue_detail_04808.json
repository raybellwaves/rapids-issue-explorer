Basically prints interesting information for GPU. \r\nIt may also be interesting to see if we could put a compare option on there, where it had a text box to compare against another application.  We should be able to use the rest api to get that information as long as user has permissions.\r\n\r\n## Phase one issues\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids-tools/issues/821",
