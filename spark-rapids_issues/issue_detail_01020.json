Please describe.**\r\nCast to `BinaryType` added in #886 has unit tests commented out because the column comparison requires `ProjectExec` to also support the `BinaryType`. The binary cast is tested for correctness as part of the MD5 hash, but should be tested independently.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nAdd `BinaryType` support for `ProjectExec` operator, which also requires implementing `getBinary` accessor in the `RapidsHostColumnVector`. Then uncomment out unit tests for casting to `BinaryType`.",
