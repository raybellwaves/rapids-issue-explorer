Currently this method is in the `GpuGenerator` trait.\r\n\r\nIn general the interface for each trait should be revised, and perhaps split up into other files as well. \r\n\r\nWe would like to take into account single rows that can explode (for GpuExplode/GpuPosExplode but possibly others) to more than the cuDF column limit, in order to avoid retrying and splitting later: https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/pull/10131",
