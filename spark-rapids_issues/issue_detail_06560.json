Please describe.**\r\nOnce #6550 goes in we will have a framework to help us avoid out of memory errors on window operations that do unbounded preceding to unbounded following.  To help us move closer to avoiding any memory issues it would be nice to try this out with something besides COUNT.  I would like to see us add in support for SUM.  We probably want to add in some configs to go with this too. \r\n\r\n1. Something that would let us disable this optimization for floats/doubles because the order of operations would change and could produce different results from one run to the next. \r\n2. A config that would let us disable window operations that require a single batch for all data (any window operations with no partition by and is not batch-able)\r\n3. A config that would let us disable window operations that require a batch for an entire partition by group. (any window operation with a partition by but is not batch-able)\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nSUM for all supported data types that supports batching for unbounded preceding to unbounded following.",
