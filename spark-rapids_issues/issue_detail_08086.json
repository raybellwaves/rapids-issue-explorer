Please describe.**\r\nSpark 3.1.x supports reading Parquet files containing timestamps in nanos and returning them as timestamps in micros in a LongType. Spark RAPIDS has the same behavior on GPU with Apache Spark, but fails with Dataproc as documented in https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/8074.\r\n\r\nWe are skipping the test on Dataproc for now. This issue is to discuss supporting this correctly on Dataproc.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nMatch the CPU behavior.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nNone\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nSee https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/8074\r\n",
