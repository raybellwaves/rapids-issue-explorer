    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nRelated to fix for https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/10165. We have a couple of specific handling for executor side broadcasts where we add in an extra shuffle to go from GpuExchange -> GpuColumnarToRow -> Exchange (EXECUTOR_BROADCAST).  We do this because the BroadcastHashJoin is expecting the Exchange node there and not a ColumnarToRow exec.  This works but its likely adding in extra overhead.  \r\n\r\nPerhaps we can make a special GPUExchange that has a doExecute and handles the columnar to row itself, but we should analyze the performance impact and if something like that will work.\r\n\r\nafter fix for https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/10165 The plan looks like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n                  +- Exchange (16)\r\n                     +- GpuColumnarToRow (15)\r\n                        +- GpuShuffleCoalesce (14)\r\n                           +- ShuffleQueryStage (13), \r\n                              +- GpuColumnarExchange (12)\r\n                                 +- GpuCoalesceBatches (11)\r\n                                    +- GpuFilter (10)\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can see that we have an extra shuffle in there.\r\n",
