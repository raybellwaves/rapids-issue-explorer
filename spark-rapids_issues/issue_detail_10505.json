This allows the Spark Plugin to pre-filter rows that may be eliminated by filters on the result of `RANK()` and `DENSE_RANK`.\r\n\r\nIt would be good to implement a similar optimization can be done for `ROW_NUMBER()` filters as well.   This isn't a big stretch.  The main challenge is that `ROW_NUMBER()` is currently implemented as a window function instead of a group scan.",
