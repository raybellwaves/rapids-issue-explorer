    "body": "Spark CPU tends to preserve the order of the stream (i.e.: non-build-side) table when performing a hash join, but the GPU will often scramble the rows coming out of a join.  Theoretically this could lead to poor compression ratios on the scrambled data vs. preserved order data coming out of a join.  We could approximate the original stream table order by sorting the gather map columns on the stream-side row ID column just before we do a gather.  It wouldn't be a true sort since the gather map can be larger than a column, but sorting the gather maps of each gather batch may be \"close enough.\"",
