Please describe.**\r\nReferring to [SPARK-35876](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-35876), `arrays_zip` has a potential problem of wrong field names before 3.04, 3.13 and 3.20. For now, the GPU overrides doesn't apply this fix because we are still supporting spark 3.11 and 3.12 (versions before 3.13).  We had better to apply this fix as soon as we drop the support for 3.11 and 3.12.\r\n",
