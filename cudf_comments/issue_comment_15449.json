        "body": "@bdice is correct, we unfortunately don't support usage of arbitrary math libraries like `spatialmath` within the UDF expression. Sometimes, you can reconstruct a formula that produces your desired result by hand, and use that instead. \r\n\r\nFor instance, if instead of \r\n```python\r\nfrom mylib import myfunc\r\n\r\ndef use_myfunc(row):\r\n    return myfunc(row['some_col'], row['some_other_col'])\r\n\r\nsr.apply(use_myfunc)\r\n```\r\nperhaps there's a way to rewrite `myfunc` in terms of scalars:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom numba import cuda\r\n\r\n@cuda.jit(device=True)\r\ndef myfunc(x, y):\r\n    return (2 * x) + (5 * y) * 3\r\n```\r\nThe limitation for now is that generally the logic of `myfunc` must be limited to scalar operations and control flow. Use of lists, dicts, or custom classes are not yet supported.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
