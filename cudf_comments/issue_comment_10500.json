        "body": "The alternative resolution to this issue would be if we changed the ColumnAccessor to use a list of columns and a list of names instead of maintaining a dictionary of name:column mappings. If we made that change, then both DataFrame and MultiIndex could support duplicate names with only a little bit of additional logic to ensure that accessor methods behave in the expected way when duplicate names exist. However, any such changes to the ColumnAccessor will be motivated by more pressing concerns than supporting duplicate names (overall package performance, stability, and robustness), so we shouldn't rush to any solutions just to solve the duplicate names problem.",
