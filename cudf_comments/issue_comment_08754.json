        "body": "Here is what is happening after some debugging. A column may or may not have nulls, and therefore may or may not have an associated mask. When we take a slice of a column, that view may or may not have an associated mask, depending on if the parent column did or did not have one. If the parent column did have a mask, it can be accessed through `base_mask`.\r\n\r\nIn this example, we're starting with a column that has no mask and assigning a null. The code detects that the slice does not possess a mask, and so creates a new one, which is then associated with the **slice** but not the **parent** mask. The data is written to the data buffer successfully, but the parent column still has no mask. This is why the problem goes away if the original column contains even one null - because then the child column can mutate `base_mask` and the result will propagate to the parent. \r\n\r\nI am looking into a few solutions here but I am worried the result won't be pretty. More to come here.",

If I'm reading this right, it indicates a bug in cudf's copy-on-write implementation that we should address.\r\n\r\nCC @galipremsagar \r\n",
