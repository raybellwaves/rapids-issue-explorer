        "body": "Yes, this is the expected memory overhead. From what I can tell, the working memory size math looks like the following:\r\n```\r\n(bytes  * 3 * sizeof(uint32)) +  (bytes * sizeof(uint32)) = (bytes * 12) + (bytes * 4) = bytes * 16\r\nwhere bytes = number of bytes in the chars child column\r\n```\r\nSo the working memory required is ~16x the number of bytes in the strings column.\r\nThis does not include any working memory required by various thrust calls or the size of the output column.\r\nMy recommendation would be to slice the column and then call normalize on the slices. \r\nUse the 16x math to help determine the slices.\r\n",
