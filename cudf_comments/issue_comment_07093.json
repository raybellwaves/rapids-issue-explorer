        "body": "Another important current example:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\n// auto col = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\r\ncudf::rolling_window(col, 0, 0, 1, ???); // null, null, null, null, null\r\ncudf::rolling_window(col, 0, 0, 1, min); // null, null, null, null, null\r\netc.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI just worked through the logic of some corner cases, and thought I would document it to help improve understanding and help others work examples. Here's the current logic for computing the window start and end.\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nsize_type preceding_window = preceding_window_begin[i];\r\nsize_type following_window = following_window_begin[i];\r\n\r\n// compute bounds\r\nsize_type start       = min(input.size(), max(0, i - preceding_window + 1));\r\nsize_type end         = min(input.size(), max(0, i + following_window + 1));\r\nsize_type start_index = min(start, end);\r\nsize_type end_index   = max(start, end); \r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the window processing loops all look like `for (size_type j = start_index; j < end_index; j++) { ... }`  -- so `end_index` is not included.\r\n\r\nI guess what is being proposed is to change it so that passing [0, 0, 1] for preceding, following, min_periods gives you the identity, rather than the current behavior where [1, 0, 1] gives you the identity. So my first attempt at the new logic would be:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nsize_type preceding_window = preceding_window_begin[i];\r\nsize_type following_window = following_window_begin[i];\r\n\r\n// compute bounds\r\nsize_type start       = min(input.size(), max(0, i - preceding_window));\r\nsize_type end         = min(input.size(), max(0, i + following_window + 1));\r\nsize_type start_index = min(start, end);\r\nsize_type end_index   = max(start, end); \r\n```\r\n(Leaving the processing loop alone.)\r\nNotably, my example above would now produce non-null results. \r\n\r\n```c++\r\n// auto col = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\r\ncudf::rolling_window(col, 0, 0, 1, ???); // [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]\r\ncudf::rolling_window(col, 0, 0, 1, min); //  1,   2,   3,   4,   5\r\netc.\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo recover the previous zero-window-size behavior would require passing `-1` for *either* one of the window sizes.\r\n\r\n```c++\r\n// auto col = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\r\ncudf::rolling_window(col, -1, 0, 1, ???); // null, null, null, null, null\r\ncudf::rolling_window(col, 0, -1, 1, ???); // null, null, null, null, null\r\n```\r\nBut (I think surprisingly), passing `-1` for both would be the same as passing zero for both!\r\n\r\n```c++\r\n// auto col = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\r\ncudf::rolling_window(col, -1, -1, 1, ???); // [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would think that (-1, -1) should result in the reverse of (1, 1).  This makes me think that we would instead want to change the implementation to this:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nsize_type preceding_window = preceding_window_begin[i];\r\nsize_type following_window = following_window_begin[i];\r\n\r\n// compute bounds\r\nsize_type start       = min(input.size() - 1, max(0, i - preceding_window));\r\nsize_type end         = min(input.size() - 1, max(0, i + following_window));\r\nsize_type start_index = min(start, end);\r\nsize_type end_index   = max(start, end); \r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd change the for loop to be inclusive. `for (size_type j = start_index; j <= end_index; j++) { ... }`\r\n\r\nImportant to also note the changes to the first argument to `min()` for `start` and `end`.\r\n\r\n```c++\r\n// auto col = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\r\n\r\n// 0, 0, 1 still gives the identity\r\ncudf::rolling_window(col, 0, 0, 1, ???); // [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]\r\n\r\n// Note the difference here: \r\ncudf::rolling_window(col, -1, 0, 1, ???); // [1 2], [2 3], [3 4], [4 5], [5]\r\ncudf::rolling_window(col, 0, -1, 1, ???); // [1], [1 2], [2 3], [3 4], [4 5]\r\n\r\n// The above are the same as the reversed, negated windows (this seems consistent)\r\ncudf::rolling_window(col, 0, 1, 1, ???); // [1 2], [2 3], [3 4], [4 5], [5]\r\ncudf::rolling_window(col, 1, 0, 1, ???); // [1], [1 2], [2 3], [3 4], [4 5]\r\n\r\n// -1 twice is the same as 1 twice, as expected\r\ncudf::rolling_window(col, 1, 1, 1, ???);   // [1 2], [2 3], [3 4], [4 5], [5]\r\ncudf::rolling_window(col, -1, -1, 1, ???); // [1 2], [2 3], [3 4], [4 5], [5]\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut now how do we do a zero window size? The only way is to set `min_periods` greater than 1.\r\n\r\n```c++\r\ncudf::rolling_window(col, 0, 0, 2, ???);   // null, null, null, null, null\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis kind of bothers me, but at least there is a way. And the rest of the cases are more self consistent than other implementations.\r\n\r\n",

        "body": "> For example @mythrocks mentioned the need for offset windows. @mythrocks can you please elaborate?\r\n\r\nAn offset window is one where the two ends of the window do not straddle the row itself. For instance, consider this column:\r\n```\r\n// auto col = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9};\r\n```\r\nConsider a `SUM()` operation over records in a span [`2 ROWS PRECEDING`, `1 ROW PRECEDING`]. All the rows participating in a window appear before (i.e. to the left) of the current row. E.g. For row at index `5`, the sum is `7` (i.e. `3+4`). \r\nAssuming the current semantics of `preceding`/`following`, we might represent this as:\r\n```\r\ncudf::rolling_window(col, 3, -1, 1, sum); // {\u03c9, 0, 1, 3, 5, 9, 11, 13, 15}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe will need to add checks so that the left bound do not appear to the right of the right bound. (E.g. `rolling_window(col 3, -3, ?, ???)`.)\r\n\r\nThis gets slightly more involved for timestamp-based queries, where the window might be from `7 DAYS PRECEDING` to `1 DAY PRECEDING`.",

For reasons that predate my work on window functions, the \"preceding\" count *includes* the current row. This is not intuitive:\r\n1. A window defined as `[1,1]` should intuitively cover *3* rows (1 preceding, 1 current, 1 following), as in SQL. But as per CUDF convention, it covers *2* (1 current, 1 following).\r\n2. A window of `[0,1]` is now a negative offset. :/\r\n\r\nThe Spark code currently passes `preceding - 1` before calling into CUDF, to match the semantics.\r\n\r\n@codereport's suggestion is to undo this, and make \"preceding\" \"actually preceding\" again.\r\nBut this needs to be done in lockstep with Spark (and Python), to reduce errors.
