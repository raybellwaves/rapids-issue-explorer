That will require some significant work to analyze all the `xfail` tests that pass (1956 tests failed with `xfail_strict=true`, and most of those are xpassed strict failures). I am going to prioritize solving locally failing tests like #7314 and reduce the number of warnings in the pytest log first, before going back to #9998.",
