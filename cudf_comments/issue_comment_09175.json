I had a similar requirement in a previous PR (https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/pull/5779), where I wanted to scatter values from a single column into multiple columns in a table.\r\n\r\nI'm also just making the observation that if we ever supported the notion of \"chunked\" columns in libcudf, the regular `scatter` and `gather` APIs would suffice for all the use cases you mentioned, as we would then easily be able to convert tables <-> chunked columns.",
