        "body": "Overall I think you're probably right that this is more work than it's worth, and that it could lead to more complexity and hurdles in setting up the pre-commit environment than we would like (such as if we tried to install a GPU-enabled library like cupy). \r\n\r\nFrom a 10000 foot view, I think the main benefit of doing these checks more is that they could uncover places where our internal dispatch patterns themselves are problematic. In cases where a function accepts an argument of type `Any` that needs to be dealt with differently depending on whether it's a pandas Series or a numpy array, the above style of if statements is probably necessary, but in other cases we may be able to use a single, simpler. ducktyped code path. However, in practice I think that's much more common when the objects being handled are our own objects (e.g. `Series` and `DataFrame` can often be handled identically rather than with separate branches) so I'm not sure how much the extra typing would actually buy us.\r\n\r\nCC @shwina who's spent quite a bit of time with type hinting.",

        "body": "I think we should revisit this after #15190 and once cudf's internals become pure Python and designed around pylibcudf. Cython substantially complicates the issue here, as do the many design issues with our current internals. I suspect that we will be able to do a much better job with type hinting at that stage than we do now. At minimum we will be able to tighten up the typing of our internals (the user-facing objects are still tricky due to the complete flexibility of the pandas API).",
