        "body": "#10360 handles the reverse binary operators. The three that you listed in your last comment are not yet done. divmod and rdivmod are out of scope for #10360 but are in general trivial to implement in the relevant classes once that PR is merged since they are just \r\n```\r\ndef __divmod__(self, other):\r\n    return self // other, self % other\r\ndef __rdivmod__(self, other):\r\n    return other // self, other % self\r\n```\r\nI think they should probably just bypass the new binop machinery, but maybe there will be a benefit to including them.\r\n\r\n`round` is a little different from other binary operations because the second parameter is optional, i.e. `round(x)` will not pass a parameter for `ndigits` so you have to make sure to handle the `None` case. Obviously trivial to do, but a reason to perhaps not shoehorn it into the same patterns and instead implement it separately.",
