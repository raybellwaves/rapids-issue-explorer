Would you please share a bit more about the processing steps you would like to apply to the `List[complex]` data?\r\n\r\nHi Gregory, thank you for looking into this. Initially I was using List[complex] however that is still memory efficient conversion. The best way I found is to cast the complex array into floats of adjacent (real,imag) which in principle shouldn't take any additional memory. I used `np.view(float32)` to cast the array into adjacent floats and then `tolist()` to store it in the dataframe. However, we are reading this column multiple times for several operations and it is not optimal to cast and recast every time. So it would be great if we can directly store the whole complex array without any conversion. ",
