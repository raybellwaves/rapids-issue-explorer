And an unfortunate amount of experimentation to push them through.\r\n\r\nSometimes the failure was silent. To more explicitly test, later, I did a cudf loop like:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# test opts for dask / dask_cudf configs\r\nvariant.read_csv('abc.csv').to_parquet('abc.parquet')\r\nfor i in range(n_parts - 1):\r\n   # will fail if 2 partitions have mismatching schema\r\n    cudf.read_parquet([f'abc.parquet/part{i}.parquet', f'abc.parquet/part{i+1}.parquet'])\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd had all sorts of `metadata`, `schema`, `write_index`, `ignore_pandas_metadata` flags. An esp weird one was complaints about not finding `\"index\"` in index/cols.\r\n\r\nThese are big windows log files (and others there) for ~real data, so a good challenge case that's not fake and represents a lot of sec/it data.",
