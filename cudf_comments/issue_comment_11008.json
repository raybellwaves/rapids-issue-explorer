        "body": ">  The functions are not simple function with one arguement but more complex operation.\r\n\r\nWhat kinds of operations do you have in mind?\r\n\r\nGeneric UDFs on lists are nearly impossible to parallelize as the user-defined function is effectively a black-box that would need to be executed serially across each list. Therefore, the amount of parallelism would be limited to just the number of lists and performance would be very poor on the GPU (it could easily be slower than the CPU).\r\n\r\nIt is a similar situation with strings, which is why we have numerous [built-in, optimized string functions](https://docs.rapids.ai/api/cudf/nightly/api_docs/string_handling.html). \r\n\r\nWe have some [built-in list functions](https://docs.rapids.ai/api/cudf/nightly/api_docs/series.html#list-handling) that are much better performing. You will have much better luck if you can find a way to express your problem in terms of these operations. There are many such operations implemented in the C++ layer that are not yet exposed to Python yet. So if there is functionality missing in these bulk functions, don't hesitate to ask as we may already have it and would just need to expose it to Python. ",
