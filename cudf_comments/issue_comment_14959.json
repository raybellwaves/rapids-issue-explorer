If given CuPy arrays (option 2), we might internally convert them to a format that follows a pyarrow array's Buffers so that we can reuse code that makes the adjustments between Arrow and Awkward, but that's our business.\r\n\r\nI suggested option 1, making a pyarrow array that would segfault if you touch it, because this works for us (we'll be careful to not dereference the GPU pointers) and if pyarrow ever does add the infrastructure to interpret it correctly, the same interface on cuDF will work for both Awkward and Arrow.",

        "body": "Just wanted to provide a quick status update here. I've put together a prototype of the device data capsule protocols in #15370. It's not usable yet for a number of reasons, largely boiling down to the need for a D2D copy at the moment (although that may still be enough of an improvement over the current D2H2D that our existing to/from_arrow methods do that you'd still find it useful for testing), but we should be able to make some progress on that soon. I've started the discussion on how best to proceed [here](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/14926#issuecomment-2014027647).",
