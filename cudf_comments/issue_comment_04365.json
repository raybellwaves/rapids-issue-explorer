So there isn't a way to return a `const scalar_device_view` based on the constness of the input. We could make it take by const ref but then we get a `scalar_device_view` that is mutable.\r\n\r\nAnother option would be to make new classes for `mutable_scalar_device_view` for each type. Then we can add const qualified methods to each typed `scalar` like `numeric_scalar<T>.device_view() const` and `numeric_scalar<T>.mutable_device_view()`.",

        "body": "This should be feasible to resolve. While @devavret is correct that you cannot overload functions based on the constness of parameters using pass-by-value semantics, the compiler can differentiate between const and non-const reference/pointer parameters. However, how would we want to address the following:\r\n1. As @devavret suggested previously, would we want separate types for mutable and non-mutable scalars, mirroring columns views?\r\n2. If we chose not to have separate types, the `_is_valid` member would need to be templated to support both const and non-const bool types. Furthermore, `scalar_device_view_base::set_valid` is currently marked `noexcept`: we would probably want to either avoid defining this method for const types (probably using `std::is_const_v` in some fashion), or mark it as conditionally `noexcept (std::is_const_v<BoolType>)` and raise an exception. The former seems like a much better solution, but I don't know if we make any API promises that would be violated by such a change.\r\n\r\nHappy to work on this if it's worth prioritizing.",
