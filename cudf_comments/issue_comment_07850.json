I know we don't want to add `kwargs` right now given the potential concerns with introducing numba incompatibilities, but perhaps `args` would be feasible?",

        "body": "Really good question. The answer for now seems to be that this would take some work. The main reason is that the `rolling` UDF pipeline is still based on the original numba-libcudf_parser-jitify approach. The central UDF is compiled by numba into PTX for a single thread [here](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/blob/branch-22.08/python/cudf/cudf/_lib/aggregation.pyx#L215) and injected into a kernel that lives in c++ [here](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/blob/branch-22.08/cpp/src/rolling/detail/rolling.cuh#L1266). This makes it a little harder to generalize. \r\n\r\nSeeing these things on the horizon is one of the main reasons we moved `.apply` to generate/launch the kernel from numba rather than using c++/jitify. Python just makes it easier to programmatically generate kernels that have, say, an arbitrary number of `*args` rather that trying to do it in c++. Hence when it came time to do that it wasn't too big of a leap.\r\n\r\nI'd want to transition this API in much the same way if possible first. I'm guessing we'd pick up null support along the way and then `*args` shouldn't be too bad after that. \r\n\r\n",
