        "body": "Thanks for filing this issue @kidman99 . At the moment, cuDF doesn't support this functionality out of the box. We support a `rolling.apply` API, but it's currently not designed to operate on multiple columns at once. To do something like this today, you'd likely need to do something like write a custom numba kernel.\r\n\r\nI'm going to update this issue to file this as a feature request.",
