I think there are two or three separate subproblems for us to investigate.\r\n\r\nPandas gives:\r\n```python\r\n>>> pivot_table.index\r\nInt64Index([1, 4], dtype='int64', name=0)\r\n>>> pivot_table.columns\r\nMultiIndex([(2, 2)],\r\n           names=[None, 1])\r\n>>> (df2 == pivot_table).all()\r\n   1\r\n2  2    True\r\ndtype: bool\r\n>>> (df2 == pivot_table).all().index\r\nMultiIndex([(2, 2)],\r\n           names=[None, 1])\r\n```\r\n\r\nI filed a PR https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/pull/11150 that fixed the `UnboundLocalError` but there are some discrepancies with Pandas in the index/columns of `pivot_table` and the index of the final result. From cuDF e16ab0174b22cf08ee919155dfba184f1f7bbff7:\r\n```python\r\n>>> pivot_table.index\r\nMultiIndex([(1,),\r\n            (4,)],\r\n           names=[0])\r\n>>> pivot_table.columns\r\nMultiIndex([(2, 2)],\r\n           names=[nan, 1.0])\r\n>>> (df2 == pivot_table).all()\r\n[2, 2]    True\r\ndtype: bool\r\n>>> (df2 == pivot_table).all().index\r\nGenericIndex([[2, 2]], dtype='list')\r\n```",
