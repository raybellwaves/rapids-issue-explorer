        "body": "@mythrocks @hyperbolic2346 I looked through the code in `writer_impl.cu` and I'm not sure what the best approach is here. Aggregate initialization is totally fine with (public) parent classes and members, but the issue with either aggregate initialization or the use of a constructor is that I see at least three variants of these objects in terms of what members are set. It's not clear to me if those are the only options, or if there might even be further combinations of attributes set in future iterations, each of which would necessitate a different constructor signature. With [C++20 designated initializers](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/aggregate_initialization#Designated_initializers) we could do this very neatly, but I don't see a clean solution right now. Am I understanding correctly how the object could be used, or do you think there is a simpler constructor we could define to improve the code in its current state?",
