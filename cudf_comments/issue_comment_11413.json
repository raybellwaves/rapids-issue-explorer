We're definitely interested in improvements around our fuzzing infrastructure and appreciate any help!\r\n\r\nWe're currently in the process of migrating our CI to use GitHub Actions and we expect that to be complete in the coming weeks. I imagine that will make it easier to integrate a tool like ClusterfuzzLite. Perhaps we can touch base again once that migration is complete?",
