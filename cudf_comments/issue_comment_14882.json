Consider [copying.pyx](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/blob/branch-24.04/python/cudf/cudf/_lib/copying.pyx). There are 6 different groupings of cudf, with a libcpp cimport in the middle. AFAICT any cimport confuses isort and makes it restart grouping. If you manually edit this file and group all the imports together and group all the cimports separately (and move the extraneous libcpp cimport up to the top) then isort will properly sort within the groups, but you have to know to do that. Is the partial sort we get better than nothing? I'm sure that's debatable, but IMHO it gives a false sense of security that our imports are sorted better than they really are. I'd rather just use ruff for everything and wait until ruff adds Cython support or cython-lint starts sorting imports.",
