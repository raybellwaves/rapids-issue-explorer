        "body": "Hi @ZelboK sorry for the slow response, let me try and answer your questions now:\r\n\r\n> For example, for the first unchecked task \"Implement OOP APIs for mixed joins\" is there an associated issue with this? A simple search through the available issues does not show anything.\r\n\r\nThere is not a separate issue for this, no. What this is referring to is that we have [a `hash_join` class](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/blob/branch-24.02/cpp/include/cudf/join.hpp#L273) that may be used to perform multiple joins where one of the tables is always the same. By building the hash table once and then probing it repeatedly, we can amortize the cost of building the hash table. That object supports hash joins only right now, but mixed joins would also benefit from the same performance gains since they are part hash join.\r\n\r\n> Is there something wrong with the current API that makes it hard for downstream users to use? Is there a general direction for refactoring the API?\r\n\r\nMore generally here I think we'd like to migrate towards API names that are less confusing. It's not obvious what a \"mixed\" or \"conditional\" join is. Ideally we'd have the function signature tell us everything we need about the nature of the join (equality vs arbitrary AST-based condition).\r\n\r\n> If I am understanding correctly, if you remove the size API from the joins this could be a breaking change correct?\r\n\r\nYes, this would be a breaking change. In general we are OK with making breaking changes, though, so that's not a problem. We just need to communicate that effectively. In this case I don't expect the breaking change to affect many users because the current approach doesn't add any meaningful functionality.\r\n",

        "body": "So for the removing size APIs, are you referring to these functions?\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.rapids.ai/api/libcudf/nightly/group__column__join.html#ga00b702723fd8953d5de802bc37965525\r\nhttps://docs.rapids.ai/api/libcudf/nightly/group__column__join.html#gaecfa4e8182521bb5630adf1bb0b609c2\r\n\r\nI imagine this just means to remove them completely and their uses anywhere? Or is there more to this issue that I am missing? In the original paragraph I see the emphasis on wanting to transition over to a \"single-kernel approach\". IIRC `mixed_join_semi` calls several kernels so perhaps it is desired to refactor this to reduce the overhead of the additional kernels? \r\n",
