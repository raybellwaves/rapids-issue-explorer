        "body": "Note that this discussion isn't unique to distributed computing. It applies to any form of \"partitioned\" input, e.g., even if you're doing \"out of core\" computing on a single GPU. \r\n\r\nI've also disliked the need for the separate `MERGE_*` aggregations. While I'm not convinced on the proposed spelling, I do think that something like parameterizing the aggregation is a good direction to explore. \r\n\r\nThe other thing I'd note is that our primary consumers of aggregation APIs do their own logic for implementing partitioned aggregations. \r\n\r\nIf we tried to hide too much of the details of the partitioned aggregation internals from them, it would become unusable. For instance, neither Dask nor Spark call libcudf's `mean_aggregation`. They compute the `sum/count` themselves and do the elementwise division. Obviously we would never eliminate `sum/count` as independent aggregations, but it does illustrate that a consumer of libcudf may have a preferred way of deriving their final result that would differ from the proposal here. \r\n\r\nI'll have to think on this some more and come back with a more complete response.
