        "body": "Hi @raybellwaves, so far we haven't done a cuDF only benchmark run to use as a direct comparison. However, we do provide some tools for determining how close to speed of light your particular workflow is. The [cudf.pandas profiler](https://docs.rapids.ai/api/cudf/stable/cudf_pandas/usage/#understanding-performance-the-cudf-pandas-profiler) in particular can highlight areas of a workflow that are hitting a CPU side bottleneck which can negatively impact your performance. Assuming the entire query is able to execute GPU side, the `cudf.pandas` python layer itself is quite lightweight, and I wouldn't expect it to have a significant effect on performance at scale. We'd probably consider such a slowdown to be somewhat buggy behavior so if you encounter that, I'd encourage reporting it as a bug. Sorry I can't offer a better comparison!",
