        "body": "After some (long) discussions, my current position is:\r\n\r\n1. cudf Python should explicitly pass memory resources to all calls to libcudf that require them.\r\n2. It was a mistake to provide defaulted `mr = rmm::mr::get_current_device_resource()` in all functions in libcudf that allocate data, since in the presence of a third-party library that is also using RMM we have no control of the provenance of this pointer and therefore cannot guarantee the lifetime of the memory resource it points to.",
