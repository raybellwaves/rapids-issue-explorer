        "body": "One important correction to the table above, nanoarrow does not support scalars and neither does the Arrow C data interface, which focuses only on arrays. Previously this was a significant concern due to concerns with Python interoperability, but it looks like pyarrow 13 patched in some critical support for scalar->array conversion that ought to make this concern moot for us now.

Once the `to_arrow_device` and `from_arrow_device` functionality is crafted, it should be pretty simple to re-implement several of the interoperability areas in terms of the Arrow C Data and Device interfaces, making strides towards eliminating the need for libarrow as a dependency in favor of nanoarrow\r\n\r\nEDIT: Just re-read and saw this was already mentioned in the OP.... oops :smile: ",
