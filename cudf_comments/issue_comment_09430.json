Those host writes depend on the `bytes_written` being updated after any previous write call.\r\n\r\nBasically we need to rename `bytes_written` to mean offset in file to write into.\r\n\r\nAlso, this means this change in the tests is wrong: https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/blob/8bb1e8603fbf5c41aad19bcbbfa39c249119b935/cpp/tests/io/parquet_test.cpp#L2061-L2073\r\nThis only worked because it's `launch::deferred`.
