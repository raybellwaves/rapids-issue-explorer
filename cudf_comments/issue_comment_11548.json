        "body": "I see an [extraneous `sort_values` call in `Column._obtain_isin_result`](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/blob/branch-22.12/python/cudf/cudf/core/column/column.py#L760) that can be removed, but I don't see any impact on performance locally when I make that change. Perhaps you can try that locally and see if it improves things. However, I suspect part of the problem is that [we are explicitly sorting and then unsorting the data](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/blob/branch-22.12/python/cudf/cudf/core/indexed_frame.py#L2072). I'd have to dig a bit deeper to understand exactly why on the previous line we are actually joining and requesting a sorted result only to unsort afterwards. I assume there's some pandas compatibility at play here, perhaps @galipremsagar or @shwina knows offhand.",
