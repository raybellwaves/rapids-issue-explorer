        "body": "To be clear this is not a super high priority for us.  We have had no one request this yet, but it is a part of Spark. This would be a feature that we could turn on or turn off.\r\n\r\nThis corresponds to a Jackson JSON parser feature, which is the JSON parser that Spark uses and just exposes some configs for.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/blob/0d5c70ff02681b4305f0d4932915e7f025e54e12/src/main/java/com/fasterxml/jackson/core/json/JsonReadFeature.java#L16-L28\r\n\r\nSome of the tests for it are at\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/blob/390472bbdf4722fe058f48bb0eff5865c8d20f73/src/test/java/com/fasterxml/jackson/core/read/CommentParsingTest.java\r\n\r\n> Do the comments only occur in between field names, values, and symbols : [ {? If so then then adding a comment state might be easier.\r\n\r\nYes, that appears to be correct.  \r\n```\r\n{ \"C\": 5/*5*/6 } \r\n```\r\nresults in an error.\r\n\r\nComment parsing within a quoted string is skipped.\r\n```\r\n{\"B\":\"2\"}\r\n{\"B\":\"2//test\"}\r\n{\"B\":\"2/*test\"}\r\n{\"B\":\"2/*test*/\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nresults in\r\n\r\n```\r\n+---------+\r\n|B        |\r\n+---------+\r\n|2        |\r\n|2//test  |\r\n|2/*test  |\r\n|2/*test*/|\r\n+---------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n> Does // comment always end in a \\n newline? \r\n\r\nThere are some bugs with this in Spark. For now I would say yes new line \\n or the end of the buffer/file. We can standardize on that. The reality is a little more complicated, but it is for features that I don't think we would support, or need to be bug for bug compatible with Spark for.\r\n\r\n> Can be sure that any / occurring outside a quoted region begins a comment?\r\n\r\nFrom reading the Jackson parser code it appears to be doing exactly that. If it sees a '/' when it is looking to skip white space, a colon, or the end, then it goes into comment skipping mode. If it sees a / by itself that is an error or something after the / that is not another / or a * it is an error.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/blob/390472bbdf4722fe058f48bb0eff5865c8d20f73/src/main/java/com/fasterxml/jackson/core/json/UTF8StreamJsonParser.java#L3265-L3282\r\n\r\n> Single-line comments might be possible, but it would bring some performance penalty from increasing the size of the state machine.\r\n\r\nI am not sure what you mean by single line comments?  Do you mean something like\r\n```\r\n{\"A\": 100}\r\n// This is a single line comment\r\n{\"B\": 200}\r\n       /* so is this... */\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n+----+----+\r\n|A   |B   |\r\n+----+----+\r\n|100 |null|\r\n|null|200 |\r\n+----+----+\r\n```\r\n\r\n> Does a block comment ever contain * characters? If so we would need to add a lookahead for block comments and this would be challenging.\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\"A\": 100 /*****************************************/, \"B\": 200}\r\n```\r\n\r\n",
