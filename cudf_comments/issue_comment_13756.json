        "body": "I disagree with this change. I think [`cudf::reduce`](https://docs.rapids.ai/api/libcudf/stable/group__aggregation__reduction.html#ga48cc284a9371891975a6219cd3d2e36e) has become too monolithic and difficult to maintain as more aggregations are added. Special rules have to be applied and adjusted (and documented) concerning combinations of parameters and parameter types. For example, certain aggregations do not accept `init` values and others only accept specific `output_type`s.\r\n\r\nI'd like to see libcudf split up the reduce algorithms into functional names like `cudf::reduction::any(), cudf::reduction::all(), cudf::reduction::max(), etc`\r\nInternally the reduce/aggregation types are implemented as `cudf::reduction::detail::any(), cudf::reduction::detail::all(), cudf::reduction::detail::max(), etc`\r\nThis will make it easier to maintain and document as well as add new reductions in the future without breaking the monolithic API. I can open a separate issue to further discuss this more practically. \r\n\r\nRegardless, I don't think we should provide a convenience wrapper on the existing `cudf::column::size()` or `cudf::column::null_count()`",

I think that this interface is the direction we ought to go, but I haven't scoped any of what that work would require.\r\n\r\nHowever, as it stands with `aggregation::Kind` today, I am not a fan of a design that allows only certain aggregations to be used as a reduction. If the reduction API accepts an enum `aggregation::Kind`, it should support all values of that enum (to the extent possible) even if they are redundant with an existing function, for \"application level\" / \"special casing\" reasons as @ttnghia and @mythrocks pointed out above.\r\n\r\nGiven the tension between these two potential next steps, I would encourage spending more effort towards the functional API that @davidwendt proposed, but I wouldn't oppose expanding the existing reduction API's `aggregation::Kind` support if we think there is enough justification, particularly potential for reuse in other parts of libcudf's aggregation code paths.",
