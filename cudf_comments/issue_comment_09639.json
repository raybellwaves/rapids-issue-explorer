        "body": "Just wanted to provide an update on this feature since we now have partial support for this and I think we have a clear picture of what's left to be done and a tentative timeline. Here is a summary.\r\n\r\n**22.10 introduced string udfs via the `strings_udf` library**\r\nWith the merge of https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/pull/11319 (as well as a flurry of follow up fixes), a new separately installable package `strings_udf` was rolled out to support this. When present in the users environment, users will find that they are able to pass string columns to UDFs through `DataFrame.apply` and `Series.apply` and utilize the following hopefully familiar python methods within those UDFs:\r\n\r\n- `str.count()`\r\n- `str.startswith()`\r\n- `str.endswith()`\r\n- `str.find()`\r\n- `str.rfind()`\r\n- `str.isalnum()`\r\n- `str.isalpha()`\r\n- `str.isdecimal()`\r\n- `str.isdigit()`\r\n- `str.islower()`\r\n- `str.isupper()`\r\n- `str.isnumeric()`\r\n- `str.isspace()`\r\n- `str.istitle()`\r\n- Comparison operators  between strings (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`)\r\n- Contains operation (`str in other`)\r\n- `len(str)`\r\n\r\n**CEC**\r\nCUDA 11.5 is currently required for this feature. CUDA enhanced compatibility is pending with PR \r\nhttps://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/pull/11884. \r\n\r\n**More features (methods that produce non numeric data)**\r\nFunctions and methods that return strings are being worked on for 22.12 with the main PR implementing the bulk of the plumbing at https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/pull/11933. After this is merged, the following features will be added in phases:\r\n\r\n- `str.capitalize()`\r\n- `str.upper()`\r\n- `str.lower()`\r\n- `str.swapcase()`\r\n- `str.ljust`\r\n- `str.rjust`,\r\n- `str.strip`\r\n- `str.lstrip`\r\n- `str.rstrip`\r\n- `str.removeprefix`\r\n- `str.removesuffix`\r\n- `str.title`\r\n- `str.center`\r\n- `str.expandtabs`\r\n- `str.replace`\r\n- `str.zfill`\r\n- `str.index`\r\n- `str.rindex`\r\n- Substring indexing (`str[1:3]`)\r\n- Concatenation (the `+` operator between strings)\r\n- Iteration (`for char in str:`)\r\n\r\nThe above functions currently require cuda dynamic global memory allocation and can therefore have some unpredictable performance characteristics. We hope to make this problem go away in the future. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Wont add for now**\r\nSome features like formatting are not yet on the roadmap, in addition to functions with structured return types such as `split` which returns a list. \r\n\r\n\r\nHopefully this gives us something to work with for now and hopefully more updates to this thread in the future!\r\n\r\n\r\n",
