On further inspection it looks like it was happening because some of the jsonl files were empty which ended up tripping/confusing the parser when reading multiple files simultaneously. \n\nFor the time being we explicitly check for empty files in the curator codebase, but I wonder if there's scope for better error messages here instead of the json parser error at location xyz.
