        "body": ">  it would be great if explode could compute null count as part of that kernel.\r\n\r\nI'm not following. `explode` returns a `table`: https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/blob/7d173c9d144a64c5e1a0467d2a5eb4181854f25e/cpp/include/cudf/lists/explode.hpp#L72\r\n\r\nAre you then constructing a `column_view` for each of the lists that were exploded? \r\n\r\nIf so, then yeah, you're going to have a problem with computing the null count of each of those `column_view`s individually. \r\n\r\nTo make that efficient, you'd have to do what we do in `cudf::split` where we compute the individual null counts in bulk with a single `segmented_null_count`: https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/blob/9c06330363db4da99803a3728b8bf44f9829f0b9/cpp/include/cudf/detail/null_mask.hpp#L186-L204",
