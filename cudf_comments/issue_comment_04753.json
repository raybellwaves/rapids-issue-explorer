If we're doing a min then we can just replace NaNs with null or filter them out completely.\r\n\r\nAggregations _might_ be able to be handled similarly, but I suspect some aggregations we won't be able to pre-process properly.",

        "body": "I believe that this is still needed. We already have a NaN equality configs for collect_set and merge_set operations. This feels similar. To be clear we could make the proposal https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/4753#issuecomment-637743952 work for some cases, but not all, and in the cases we can make it work it feels unreasonable to do so.\r\n\r\nInstead of doing a single reduction we would have to \r\n\r\n1. call `is_nan`\r\n2. do an `any` reduction to see if we have to go any further.\r\n3. If there are any nans do an all reduction.\r\n4. If they are all nans stop because the result will be NaN\r\n5. if they are not all nans, then call `replace_nans` to replace the NaN with a min or max value depending on the operation being done.\r\n\r\nThis makes the code a little more complicated, but we can isolate it and it is not likely to cause too many issues.\r\n\r\nFor group by aggregations it would be much more complicated. We could do it but to be able to tell on a per group basis if we need to replace a NaN or not is going to require us to do a group by aggregation to check the same any/all conditions and then find a way to put that back with the original input data.  That means either doing a join with the original input data on the grouping keys or sorting the data. Both of those would have very large performance penalties, even in the common case when there are no NaN values.\r\n\r\nFor windowing, which we now also need to support, there is no way to do this.  We could have a single row that contributes to multiple separate aggregations. Some of which may have all of the values be NaN. Some of which may have only a few of the values be NaNs.  There is no way for us to fix up the input data to work around this.",
