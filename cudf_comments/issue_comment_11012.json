I prefer breaking these up as:\r\n\r\n- `lexicographical/row_operators.cuh`\r\n- `equality/row_operators.cuh`\r\n- `hash/row_operators.cuh`\r\n\r\nThe reason I prefer to split them up this way is that we will be mirroring the sub-directory structure with the namespaces.\r\n\r\nAny common code can be present in `row_operators_common.cuh/hpp`.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, in my PR I will add some redundancy if any code in `experimental` relies on the current version of `row_operators.cuh` by copying over those sections. By doing this, when we are ready to drop `experimental`, we just delete the old `row_operators.cuh`, move up contents of `experimental` to the parent directory, and perform simple find-and-replace to remove `experimental::` from the call sites.",
