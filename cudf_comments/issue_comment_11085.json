Is fixing this within the scope of the current work?\r\n\r\nNo, this needs deep-seated changes in the way `iloc` indexing and `__setitem__` work. Basically this is all unsafe because there's a significant portion of the code that assumes that, given a `Column`, there is only ever one higher-level holder of the `Column`, and hence that replacing the column associated with a `Series` object with a copy is safe.\r\n\r\nThis is, unfortunately, demonstrably not true (@shwina's example is one, here are a few more):\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport cudf\r\nimport rmm\r\ns = cudf.Series([1,2,3,4])\r\nsview = s.iloc[:]\r\n\r\ndef owner(buf):\r\n    while not isinstance(buf, rmm.DeviceBuffer):\r\n         buf = buf.owner\r\n    return buf.ptr\r\n\r\n\r\nassert owner(s._column.data) == owner(sview._column.data) # True\r\n\r\ns.iloc[0:2] = [4,5]\r\n\r\nassert owner(s._column.data) == owner(sview._column.data) # False\r\n\r\nsview = s.iloc[:]\r\n\r\nassert owner(s._column.data) == owner(sview._column.data) # True\r\n\r\ns.iloc[[1,3]] = [7, 8]\r\n\r\nassert owner(s._column.data) == owner(sview._column.data) # False\r\n\r\nsview = s.iloc[:]\r\n\r\nassert owner(s._column.data) == owner(sview._column.data) # True\r\n\r\ns.iloc[[False, True, True, False]] = [7, 8]\r\n\r\nassert owner(s._column.data) == owner(sview._column.data) # False\r\n\r\n# This one works\r\n\r\nsview = s.iloc[:]\r\n\r\nassert owner(s._column.data) == owner(sview._column.data) # True\r\n\r\ns.iloc[1::1] = 2\r\n\r\nassert owner(s._column.data) == owner(sview._column.data) # True\r\n\r\n# But this doesn't\r\n\r\nsview = s.iloc[:]\r\n\r\nassert owner(s._column.data) == owner(sview._column.data) # True\r\n\r\ns.iloc[1::1] = [1,2,3]\r\n\r\nassert owner(s._column.data) == owner(sview._column.data) # False\r\n```\r\n\r\n(I have not checked the dataframe-equivalent ones)",
