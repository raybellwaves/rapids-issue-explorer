        "body": "This needs to happen in the `cudf` implementation of `merge` (which doesn't support `indicator` either). The implementation is relatively straightforward. You carry around an extra column that is `2^0` for the left frame, `2^1` for the right frame. Then you merge, and sum those columns (treating null as zero). Where this result column is `2^0`, the input only appeared in the left frame, where it is `2^1` it only appeared in the right frame, if it's `3`, it appeared in both. This can be encoded as a categorical column.\r\n\r\nCare to try implementing that (relevant code is in `cudf/python/core/join/join.py`)?",
