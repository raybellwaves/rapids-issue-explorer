In 0.15 we are aiming to add at least 10 new types (4 unsigned int types, 4 timestamp types, list column type, decimal fixed-point type). Naturally this will increase compile time and binary size.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in 0.14 we dropped all of the legacy APIs that were previously deprecated, which reduced compile time a bit, and significantly reduced binary size.  There have been and will continue to be various efforts to reduce compile time  of  certain components.

You can technically get Clang to compile device code, so that may be a path worth exploring using Clang + these tools.\r\n\r\nOut of curiosity I gave this a quick shot. (Unsurprisingly) clang does not currently support the experimental CUDA features that we have enabled (`--expt-extended-lambda --expt-relaxed-constexpr`) so the compilation terminates pretty quickly. Not sure if there are other downstream issues that we would face if we attempted this after stripping those out (not suggesting that we should, although #7795 remains open so maybe it is worth pursuing).",

        "body": "You're right, it does. I removed those and made some progress, but not nearly enough for a working build with clang yet. Here's a list of necessary changes so far:\r\n- Remove all `CUDF_CUDA_FLAGS` set in ConfigureCUDA.cmake. Most are either unsupported or ignored (including some of the warnings flags), so the blanket removal is easiest.\r\n- Remove `[[nodiscard]]` attributes, which don't appear to be supported in clang device code yet.\r\n- Set `-D__STRICT_ANSI__` as a CUDA compiler flag. Otherwise it tries to compile float128 code, which is not yet supported in clang.\r\n- Pass `-fcuda-allow-variadic-functions` to the clang compiler (or via the CMake configure CLI `-DCMAKE_CUDA_FLAGS=\"-Xclang -fcuda-allow-variadic-functions\"`\r\n\r\nAt this point I start seeing failures like this:\r\n```\r\n...type_traits:2777:5: error: no type named 'type' in 'std::invoke_result<cudf::detail::indexalator_factory::nullable_index_accessor, int>'\r\n```\r\nand \r\n```\r\nerror: type 'thrust::transform_iterator<(lambda at ...gather.cu:49:26), cudf::detail::input_indexalator>::super_t' (aka 'iterator_adaptor<transform_iterator<(lambda at ...gather.cu:49:26), cudf::detail::input_indexalator, thrust::use_default, thrust::use_default>, cudf::detail::input_indexalator, int, thrust::use_default, std::random_access_iterator_tag, int>') is not a direct or virtual base of 'thrust::transform_iterator<(lambda at ...gather.cu:49:26), cudf::detail::input_indexalator>'\r\n```\r\nI need to track this down a bit further, but it looks like some aspect of how thrust SFINAEs different code paths isn't supported in clang device code yet either.",
