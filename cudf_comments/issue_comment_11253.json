        "body": "Hi @ShahRishi, we'd love your help! It's not quite that simple, although it's close. You'll need to build the documentation with the checks turned on (that's how you run it), but then you will also need to fix any issues that it finds. [Here are the instructions on building the docs](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/tree/branch-22.08/docs/cudf). My recommendation would probably be to clone the repository and install the conda environment as it recommends, but instead of building cudf from source just try to install cudf from the `rapidsai-nightly` conda channel so that you get the most up-to-date version of the package without having to build it yourself. Then you should be able to start from step 2 on that page and build the documentation as described. Does that make sense? Let me know if you have any further questions!",

Here's a command that gives a quick idea of what warnings are showing up:\r\n```\r\ngrep -v WARNING warnings_cudf_numpydoc.txt | sort | uniq\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo get just a list of error codes you can also do\r\n```\r\ngrep -v WARNING warnings_cudf_numpydoc.txt | sort | uniq | awk '{printf $1\"\\n\"}' | uniq\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom that, I see:\r\n```\r\nES01:\r\nEX01:\r\nGL01:\r\nGL02:\r\nGL03:\r\nGL06:\r\nGL07:\r\nGL08:\r\nPR01:\r\nPR02:\r\nPR03:\r\nPR04:\r\nPR05:\r\nPR06:\r\nPR07:\r\nPR08:\r\nPR09:\r\nPR10:\r\nRT01:\r\nRT02:\r\nRT03:\r\nRT04:\r\nRT05:\r\nSA01:\r\nSA02:\r\nSA04:\r\nSS03:\r\nSS05:\r\nSS06:\r\n*\r\n/home/rishis/anaconda3/envs/cudf_dev/lib/python3.9/site-packages/cudf/core/series.py:docstring\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom looking through that output, these all look like real errors that we should fix (although a couple of them are very pedantic like ending every line with a period). We can save the last few of lines until the end since those represent issues beyond just the docs (mostly `AttributeError` from something failing to import). The `numpydoc` website has [a full list of error codes](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/validation.html#built-in-validation-checks) to explain what each of these are. Since these all do look like real errors, my recommendation would be to pick one or two of the above error codes at a time, find all of the issues, and make a PR fixing just that issue. That should make it fairly easy to get your PRs reviewed quickly. Does that make sense?",
