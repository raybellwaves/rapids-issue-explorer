        "body": "I don't like the idea of having the ability to do self-comparison inside two-table-comparision. Instead, the ability to do comparison either between `lhs-lhs`, `lhs-rhs` and `rhs-rhs` should be a \"mixed comparison\" thus we should have a new comparator alongside with `self_comparator` and `two_table_comparator`. Something may be called `mixed_table_compartor`. Maybe with this comparator, we can remove `two_table_comparator` completely, but we should not use the name \"two table comparator\" for mixed comparison like that.",
