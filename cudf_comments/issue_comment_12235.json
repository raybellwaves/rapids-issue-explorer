I _also_ don't like libraries that print information (especially warnings) unconditionally on import, so I don't particularly like this suggestion, just raising the possibility. Alternatively it could be set up via logging of some sort. I think we can safely assume that no matter how we broadcast this some users will not read the docs/notification/warning/etc and be surprised at the behavior, but hopefully (and I think it's likely that) more people are happy about the pool usage improving default performance.\r\n- Similar to the PyTorch example where cudf is imported later, could this change potentially break scripts that are using rmm to allocate memory prior to the cudf import? I believe that the answer is no since we made the necessary changes to save an allocator used for any allocation such that `set_allocator` won't make accessing allocations using the prior allocator UB, just want to be sure.",

I think the best option is simply not to set a maximum pool size and let the pool grow to whatever size it can. This is what happens today if you do `cudf.set_allocator(pool=True)`. Setting the `max_pool_size` to the amount of memory available at import time may be a bad idea because additional memory might be freed up later. \r\n\r\n> Can we wrap the allocator in an adapter that checks (on OOM) whether memory has been allocated outside of the pool (perhaps just using a naive metric like total_gpu_mem - pool_size) and provides the user a more useful error?\r\n\r\nWe can. I'm not opposed to it, but what can the user do with that information? When the GPU is e.g., being shared by multiple processes, it may even be misleading to say that their code is allocating memory outside of RMM's knowledge.\r\n\r\n> Should we consider adding some notification on import cudf that indicates that such a change is being made?\r\n\r\nGiven that other libraries like CuPy and PyTorch also use a pool by default, I don't know if this is very controversial. I want to say that 99% of users won't ever know or care. \r\n\r\n> could this change potentially break scripts that are using rmm to allocate memory prior to the cudf import? \r\n\r\nI don't believe so (especially if we choose an initial pool size of 0). You are right that we keep a reference to the previous memory resource around so there's no danger/UB.",

Personally I tend to be against this sort of implicit behavior and prefer that it always be opt-in, but it seems like many feel that the benefit to users outweighs potential risks (but not all, CC @wence- and @pentschev). That said, increasing cudf import times is a concrete cost that I probably wouldn't be willing to stomach for pytorch, whereas for cupy and numba we are importing them already so the question is more of a philosophical one of whether or not we should have side effects to importing cudf.",

I agree with the technical challenges of doing this but the actual impact of this is 99% of customers will never use POOL and we will have to be fine with it.     \r\n\r\n\r\n2. Configuring Pytorch to use rmm torch allocator. \r\n\r\nRegarding 2,  My fear is that most users wont know if this is configurable  and I think there is also no  clean way for us to inform user when they run into OOMs .  \r\n\r\nThat said , we cant probably use the RMM Pool cleanly right now with Pytorch as that can lead to fragmentation. We will have to probably use the `async ` memory allocator. \r\n\r\nExample of what a user will have to configure currently is below: \r\n```\r\n    import cudf\r\n    import cupy\r\n    import rmm\r\n\r\n    mr = rmm.mr.CudaAsyncMemoryResource()\r\n    rmm.mr.set_current_device_resource(mr)\r\n    torch.cuda.memory.change_current_allocator(rmm.rmm_torch_allocator)\r\n    cupy.cuda.set_allocator(rmm.allocators.cupy.rmm_cupy_allocator)\r\n```    \r\n\r\n",

        "body": "There is a great discussion in this issue so far, and it (implicitly) has mostly referred to a default _unmanaged_ (device-only) pool. The issue of a default memory resource is coming up again in the context of preventing OOM errors for the single workstation, beginner cuDF user, where a default _managed_ memory resource could be a good solution. \r\n\r\nI'm interested to learn more about the default pool behavior in cupy and pytorch as mentioned [above](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/12235#issuecomment-1331229185). I'm also interested to learn more about how experienced users and other libraries could automatically be opted-out of a default managed resource, while still providing this feature automatically to the beginner user.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we could have a hook on the first column allocation that checks if RMM has ever had `reinitialize` called, and if not, create a managed pool with initial size zero. Then when the pool grows we can add a hook to check the available system memory and throw an OOM exception well before completely locking up the system.",
