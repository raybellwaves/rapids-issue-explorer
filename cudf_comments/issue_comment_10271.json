        "body": "I think this could possibly be done with the workaround you suggest and adding a bit of index \"magic\" because we know that all columns being exploded must have, for any given row, each list must have the same number of elements.\r\n\r\nIf you create a monotonically increasing id , you can merge with that key across your frames. Then, I think you can leverage the = elements per list requirement to do something like:\r\n\r\n```python\r\noriginal_df = ...\r\nmerged_result = ...\r\n\r\nindex_repeats = = original_df.repeat(original_df[col].list.len().replace(0, 1)) # dont drop ones with 0 elements, so set as 1\r\nmerged_result.set_index(cudf.RangeIndex(start=0, stop=len(original_df)).repeat(index_repeats))\r\n```\r\n\r\nEDIT: This logic might get messy with more than a few columns, as you'd need to keep track of which frames get which columns",
