That's the only exception I can think of right now where cudf executes CPU-only code (it copies to device and returns a GPU dataframe at the end). Those are documented in the notes on this page: https://docs.rapids.ai/api/cudf/stable/user_guide/io/io/\r\n\r\nI can think of a few algorithms where cudf has cut down on extraneous copies/sorting over the last few releases (like `drop_duplicates`). If any specific cases come to mind, please file issues for those! We're aiming to reduce intermediate memory usage in cudf and these would likely align with that goal (in addition to improving performance).",

[As I commented on this in #15837, though](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/pull/15837#discussion_r1619623069), I don't think options are the right way to expose this. options are user-facing, whereas what we're trying to accomplish here is something for developers. Some environment variables documented in the developer guide are probably closer to what I would envision, especially for the first one (pandas_debugging). I don't see a reason for a user to ever need that one. I could envision exposing some internal APIs to control the second case (fallback_debugging) because in that scenario it could be useful to have the profiler hook into these so that users could collect information on why fallback occurred.",
