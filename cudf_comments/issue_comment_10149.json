        "body": "> I started an experiment in this direction before I re-read this issue and realized @SurajAralihalli was assigned here. With apologies to @SurajAralihalli, I think I have a good start on the atomics refactoring in #14962. I would like to get that PR merged first, because it should be a standalone improvement, and then we can revisit the changes that were originally reverted.\r\n\r\nThanks @bdice for letting me know!",
