This effort is described here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/13921\r\n\r\nSo while you're touching `sort.pyx`, I wonder if it's worth also just refactoring it out into the new `pylibcudf` package. Is that something you would be interested in taking on?\r\n\r\nHappy to answer any questions you might have here, or on the RAPIDS Slack!",
