Without a comparator for tables/columns and scalars, lifetime management of a column derived from the scalar gets very awkward. https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/blob/ee15d1c10b51169abe26b1fa052ae568296696d5/cpp/src/lists/contains.cu#L251-L268\r\n\r\nI commented here:\r\nhttps://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/pull/10548/files#r946174668\r\n\r\n> Upon further investigation: the current state is quite yucky, with lifetime management for one code path but not the other. We should be able to handle this a different way, by making a comparator that accepts a scalar, owns the temporary column, and accepts one index (for the column/table input). Centralizing lifetime management in the comparator has been part of our existing designs, so that's probably good to continue.\r\n> There aren't a lot of alternatives I can see without improving this at the comparator level, but it's pretty gross in the current state.\r\n",
