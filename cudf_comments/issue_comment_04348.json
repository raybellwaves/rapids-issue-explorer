        "body": "No, my sudden interest in these mostly comes from needing to handle potentially changing defaults in pandas 2.0. I don't think that these are necessarily critical features to support, but given that the majority of our defaults are misaligned with pandas defaults (because we don't support the other option) I think we ought to think through the consequences for unwary pandas users. At the moment we throw out a bunch of warnings on basically any usage of `str.wrap` because our parameter defaults don't match pandas because we don't support the alternatives. That's also not a great UX.\r\n\r\nCC @shwina ",
