Use an algorithm (thrust:: or std::) if possible before ever writing a custom kernel -- this way you write a per-element device functor instead, and indexing is handled for you.\r\n2. If a custom kernel must be written, it should use device-side algorithms instead of raw loops.\r\n3. If a raw grid-stride loop is required and an existing algorithm won't work, we should provide utilities to abstract the iteration and or the range and use auto for the type to avoid these mistakes.",
