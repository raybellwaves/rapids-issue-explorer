        "body": "Hi @dlee992 , thanks so much for your interest in taking this on! I thought I'd share a little about how I'd approach this just to get you off the ground. \r\n\r\nThe main tests I recommend trying to pass first would be [these ones which test simple reductions](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/blob/branch-23.04/python/cudf/cudf/tests/test_groupby.py#L403-L407). This test is parameterized based on a list of supported types we hardcode in `groupby_typing`. I tried adding `int32` locally and it looks like a lot works already when running the test:\r\n\r\n```\r\nerror   : Undefined reference to 'BlockMin_int32' in '<cudapy-ptx>'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis hopefully means that adding a couple of lines around [here in the c++ library](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/blob/branch-23.04/python/cudf/udf_cpp/groupby/function.cu#L300) could pass a bunch of tests right off the bat if we're lucky :)\r\n\r\nHappy to help at any time on the [RAPIDS goAI Slack](https://rapids-goai.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-trnsul8g-Sblci8dk6dIoEeGpoFcFOQ#/shared-invite/email) by the way, just ping me with any questions. Good luck!\r\n",
