Row groups have 10k elements, so when there are no nulls they fill 1250 bytes completely. \r\nWhen nulls are present, the last byte might be incomplete. Other readers (pyarrow, Spark) expect all bits in encoded column to be valid (with the exception of last byte in the stripe).\r\n\r\nThus, we need to encode bool values from the next row group into the incomplete byte and set the next row group starting offset to the correct bit within the data encoded as part of the current row group. This offsets the encoding of the next row groups and the effect ripples over the entire stripe. Significant changes are needed to the current implementation to be able to support this.",
