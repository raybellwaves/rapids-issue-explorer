        "body": "The `rmm::device_buffer` has a [set_stream](https://docs.rapids.ai/api/librmm/nightly/classrmm_1_1device__buffer.html#ab271ced85f304e3061a3ff72526dbc37) method. This proposed API would call that method of the underlying buffer.\r\n\r\nThis seems reasonable from what I can tell, but its utility (transferring ownership between streams) will be limited until we expose streams publicly, aside from the internal I/O methods that @hyperbolic2346 is working on. Perhaps we should wait to add this to the public API until we have a broader discussion of adding streams to libcudf APIs?",
