        "body": "Thanks for writing this up, @trivialfis! Firstly, I'm not super familiar with CUDA IPC and any associated pitfalls, so I'll cc @trxcllnt and @kkraus14 here, who may be able to comment more on the suggested approach and API.\r\n\r\nRegarding the suggestion to use a 'jsonified' interchange protocol for messaging, I do have some concerns. Firstly, the dataframe interchange protocol has the narrower goal of enabling interchange between Python libraries. The semantics may not always match 1-to-1 with IPC.\r\n\r\nSecondly, and relatedly, I'm concerned that we would effectively be introducing a new IPC format, while others like [Feather](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/feather.html) already exist. Would supporting Feather solve this problem using a more standard approach? \r\n\r\nWe recently [removed](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/pull/10995/) the bit of functionality around the Arrow IPC Format from cudf. I don't believe Spark was supporting that, and on the Python side, it was largely unused. More importantly, my understanding was that for GPU-resident data, the implementation wasn't even truly zero-copy (@trxcllnt can confirm). But perhaps we could consider bringing back (and fixing) that code?\r\n",

        "body": "@shwina Thank you for the reply.\r\n\r\n> Would supporting Feather solve this problem using a more standard approach?\r\n\r\nI looked into arrow IPC, which allows writing and reading data efficiently, and reading can be optimized with memory mapped file.  But still, we will have to go through device -> host then host -> device along with read-write to socket/mmap/pipe/file for transferring data from jvm to python process. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, the wording of the document seems a little bit vague.\r\n\r\n> Secondly, and relatedly, I'm concerned that we would effectively be introducing a new IPC format\r\n\r\nI think it will remain proprietary and doesn't need to be stable for some period of time since we are transferring CUDA IPC mem handle. Anyone who wants to read the data must understand how to use CUDA API to obtain the pointer. For the \"jsonify df protocol\", that's because the protocol has complete information about the dataframe and I would like to avoid reinventing the wheel.\r\n\r\n> my understanding was that for GPU-resident data, the implementation wasn't even truly zero-copy\r\n\r\nIf it's close to zero-copy then it's probably good enough. The best case scenario is there's a way to let another process view the data in the current process without incurring significant overhead in data transfer using only arrow. At the moment, CUDA IPC handle (not arrow CUDA writer, but the IPC API provided by CUDA toolkit) is the only way I can think of: https://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/latest/cuda/ipc.html",

        "body": "The previous Arrow IPC code that was recently removed didn't go through host memory, it was entirely in GPU. That being said it did require a lightweight serialization to pack the data of a dataframe into a single buffer that could be IPCed instead of having to IPC each underlying buffer. Here's the spec: https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Columnar.html#ipc-streaming-format. One issue with this is that it expects the Schema to be inline with the data and it doesn't really make sense for the Schema to be in GPU memory.\r\n\r\nThe dataframe interchange protocol referenced by @shwina currently uses pointers within a process and has a pointer per underlying buffer in the dataframe. This could be an arbitrarily large number of buffers depending on the number of columns and their types. You could imagine building something similar to this and using CUDA IPC handles instead of pointers as well as serializing all of the Python class hierarchy and information surrounding it and using some form of side channel to move that between processes. Looks like you've roughly sketched this out already.\r\n\r\nIdeally, something like this would get handled in C/C++ instead of in Python so that the implementation can be reused across languages.",

They are good starting points but not suitable for transferring ownership between 2 different language environments due to the use of pickle in type serialization.\r\n\r\n`pickle` is used only for serializing and deserializing metadata between Python processes. For this use-case, couldn't we use e.g., json for the metadata, and `serialize()` for the data? \r\n\r\nIntra-node transfers via UCX _should_ use CUDA IPC. For communication between a Python process using cuDF, and a JVM process running PySpark, I can imagine using ucx-py for sending/writing messages and UCX for receiving/reading , although admittedly I'm not clear on the implementation details. cc: @pentschev who is the expert in this area and could provide more insight.",

        "body": "I've checked with UCX devs and zero-copy in the truest sense (directly accessing the remote process' memory without need for a local copy) is not currently supported by UCX. For the short-term, AFAICT the only way to achieve true zero-copy would be to manually handle CUDA IPC.\r\n\r\nWhat we can do with UCX is as Ashwin said already above, transfer intra-GPU data via CUDA IPC. On a V100, this achieves bandwidth > 350GB/s (see [`CUDA_IPC_SELF` in UCX-Py's nightly benchmark charts](https://raw.githack.com/pentschev/ucx-py-ci/test-results/assets/ucx-py-barchart.html)), but will require data duplication while transferring.\r\n\r\nBecause UCX-Py is an interface for UCX, we could do UCX-Py<->UCX transfers with no problem, we are required to first establish endpoints between UCX workers on both processes. I know Spark uses Java bindings for UCX, but I'm not familiar with either Spark nor the Java bindings internals, is there any kind of interface within PySpark for UCX? Given the \"Py\" prefix, I would assume we could just use UCX-Py on both cuDF and PySpark ends, but maybe there's already some UCX within PySpark or that it could utilize.",

IOW, you won't get the CUDA IPC handle to do the `cudaMemcpy` directly when using the UCP layer of UCX (which is what UCX-Py exposes). In UCX-Py, you would do that using [`send`](https://ucx-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#ucp.Endpoint.send)/[`recv`](https://ucx-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#ucp.Endpoint.recv) methods.\r\n\r\nWe have a [complete unit test for cuDF message transfer](https://github.com/rapidsai/ucx-py/blob/branch-0.28/tests/test_custom_send_recv.py), it shows the entire procedure to connect two processes (one being the listener and another being the client), which one process will [`write`](https://github.com/rapidsai/ucx-py/blob/f585c5084f4fa1cc1ff7f1f21dd24a8bcea3c630/tests/test_custom_send_recv.py#L42-L58) and another will [`read`](https://github.com/rapidsai/ucx-py/blob/f585c5084f4fa1cc1ff7f1f21dd24a8bcea3c630/tests/test_custom_send_recv.py#L60-L88)",

        "body": "Hi, let me make a brief summary on the topic, there are serval proposed approaches:\r\n1. Use Arrow IPC format along with its IO procedures. This is too slow and incurs data copies. Also, we need to patch arrow to handle the memory pool properly. Lastly, arrow_gpu dependency will be introduced back to cuDF along with libcuda.so.\r\n2. Define custom IPC routines in cuDF with one handle per buffer as in https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/pull/11564 . This adds a non-trivial amount of code to the cuDF which might be a potential burden on future maintenance for cuDF developers. But the upside is that there's no data copy in C++.\r\n3. Define custom IPC routines in cuDF with one handle for a packed buffer based on `pack` and `unpack` functions. Tested by @wbo4958 and advocated by @abellina. This can reduce the amount of code compared to the per-column approach and is easier to implement and maintain. It needs a pair of methods in cuDF and some memory management for opened memory handle. Also, an extra copy of the data will be created. But overall is easier if we can live with the copy.\r\n4. Use UCX. This has already been implemented in other places and also has some integration in spark. But mentioned by @abellina , introducing UCX into dependencies might impose additional configuration onto users due to signal handling conflicts between UCX and jvm.\r\n5. Host the IPC code in https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/6391 .",

        "body": "Regarding the overhead of opening memory handles, from my very simple test with dataframe generated by:\r\n``` python\r\n    from cudf.testing.dataset_generator import rand_dataframe\r\n    df = rand_dataframe([{\"dtype\": \"float32\", \"null_frequency\": 0.0, \"cardinality\": 10}] * n_columns, rows=int(1e5))\r\n    df = cudf.DataFrame.from_arrow(df)\r\n````\r\n\r\nWith 128 primitive dtype columns, `export_ipc\u200b` takes 0.003928661346435547 seconds, `import_ipc` takes 0.801159143447876 seconds. With 1024 primitive dtype columns, `export_ipc`\u200b takes 0.03810715675354004 while `import_ipc\u200b` takes 0.9540588855743408.  According to the CUDA document of [cudaIpcGetMemHandle](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-runtime-api/group__CUDART__DEVICE.html#group__CUDART__DEVICE_1g8a37f7dfafaca652391d0758b3667539) (the exporter):\r\n\r\n> This is a lightweight operation and may be called multiple times on an allocation without adverse effects\r\n\r\nI think the operation is fairly cheap, might even be cheaper than memory copies inside `pack`.  The problem is mostly about code gain. With the `pack` and `unpack` solution the code can be leaner. One additional concern raised by @abellina is memory deallocation on the producer side. We either have to export an additional RAII struct that tells the producer when it's safe to deallocate the dataframe or we make another copy on the consumer side.",

I can change the PR to using 3) if it's believed to be a better alternative. \r\n\r\nAlso, I just found out that in https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/pull/11564 , even though there's no copy in c++, the cython code still does a copy with `Column.from_column_view` called inside `columns_from_table_view`. Is there a way to avoid that copy?\r\n\r\n@abellina emphasized the importance of making sure the producer doesn't free the dataframe until the consumer is finished. That has an implication that, if the consumer never actually import the IPC message, the producer should keep the dataframe around forever. There are two possible ways to achieve this: Add a remote callback into the IPC message as suggested by Alessandro and use it for decreasing the reference counter in Python and Java.  An alternative to this is to handle the lifetime of dataframe on the user side (say, spark) instead of putting it into cuDF. (which I prefer, but the cuDF API becomes less safe).",

IIRC, if you don't provide an owner, the best we can do is copy from the column view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
