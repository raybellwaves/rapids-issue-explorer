        "body": "_Should_ is stronger than I really intended. I wanted to open this issue to document an inconsistency that I noticed and was previously unaware of, and because we've been moving towards much stricter pandas compatibility of late. For example, we are definitely moving away from reference semantics in cuDF Python in places where pandas returns copies because downside of surprising users is not worth the smaller memory footprint. In this case, though, I think the downside of the current behavior is pretty negligible and would be fine with not changing it. I just want there to be a record of the decision if that's what we choose.\r\n\r\nCC @shwina @galipremsagar who have been involved with related decisions recently.",
