ORC is already doing timezone conversions, and that's why I mention it here.  It would be slightly more efficient to have ORC directly convert to a specified timezone rather than convert to UTC and then the caller converts to another timezone.\r\n\r\nI agree that a standalone utility method would be best if we're only going to have one way to rebase timestamps.  That can apply to the CSV and Parquet loaders which don't do any timezone conversions today.\r\n\r\nThe utility would also provide a way to convert Spark timestamps back to UTC.  This would probably be needed when cudf supports writing CSV, Parquet, and ORC, as I would expect those writers to assume all timestamps are UTC.  Spark would need to convert timestamps relative to the JVM timezone to UTC for cudf writing unless the writers supported a parameter specifying the timestamp timezone reference.\r\n",
