        "body": "In early prototypes of the AST implementation there was logic in the kernels to automatically swap the left and right tables so that the kernel configuration would always run over the left table. I removed this because that code path was swapping the tables without making the necessary associated modifications to the expression (e.g. `operation(GREATER, 0, 1)` needs to be converted to `operation(GREATER, 1, 0)`), leading to incorrect results. It should definitely be possible to do this in a safe way, though, so I'll look into the best way to accomplish that.",

        "body": "@jlowe is correct, this has only been solved for inner joins. Solving it for other types of joins will be substantially more complicated and will likely require an entirely new algorithm, and the new algorithm will most likely have measurably larger overhead. Perhaps there is a generic solution that does not introduce any more work, but I was not able to come up with one at the time that this issue was originally raised, even if I allowed for modification of the expression IIRC.\r\n\r\nMost likely what we would need to do is some careful benchmarking of the current approach against a new approach for different data sizes to determine tradeoffs and perform a runtime dispatch to the appropriate code path depending on the size imbalance. That will also balloon compile time so it's something that we will have to consider very carefully.",
