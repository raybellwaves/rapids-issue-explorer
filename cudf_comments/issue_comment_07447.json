I'm not sure if `bit_cast` belongs there. \r\n\r\n> There are tests/utilities and tests/utilities_test which have confusing names.\r\n\r\nCan you elaborate? The former are test utilities and the latter are tests _of_ the utilities. \r\n\r\n> File name/extensions are inconsistent. For example, many unit tests in the tests/<some test name> are written in both .cu and .cpp extensions. Of course, .cu file may be required here, but having the tests written in two file extensions at the same time make things look messy.\r\n\r\nThis one doesn't sound like an issue to me. We prefer to write tests as `.cpp` files when we can as they usually compile faster, but sometimes they need to be `.cu` if they have device code.",

The former are test utilities and the latter are tests _of_ the utilities.\r\n\r\nTheir names already expose confusion. Which one is \"utilities\" of the test suite (utilities or utilities_test)? And which one is the unit tests for `src/utilities` (`tests/utilities`?)??? \r\n\r\nThis is just one example. I would like to rename the folders that contain implementation for testing helpers to something like `_utilities` so we can know they are private helpers, not the unit tests.",
