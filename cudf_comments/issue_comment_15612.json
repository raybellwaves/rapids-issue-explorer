        "body": "Measured memory use by `hostdevice_vector` in cuIO benchmarks as a percentage of peak device memory use. The pinned memory use is proportional to device memory use, so we can use the peak device memory use as a measure of how much pinned memory we would need if we used up all device memory.\r\nThe results show that we would never fall back to new pinned allocations with a pinned pool sized at 4% of device memory capacity. However, even at 0.5%, the pool can be used to allocate 90% of used pinned memory without additional allocations.\r\n![image](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/assets/16005690/dcdc9d0e-5f08-4759-b7b6-14552185e1e4)",
