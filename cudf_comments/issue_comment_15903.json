        "body": "Tree representation:\r\n\r\nThis feature introduces a new `column_tree_csr` struct that stores the column tree representation in CSR format. The nodes are renumbered level-wise instead of being directly mapped to column ids. This serves two purposes - (i) sub-trees matching input dtype schema can be skipped in between-column pruning, and (ii) sub-trees matching non-conforming dtypes in mixed type columns can be similarly skipped (within-column pruning).\r\nThe key advantage of wrapping column properties -  mixed types and map types support, column pruning, ignoring null literals, column validity, and array of arrays support - as 'non-zero' values in `column_tree_csr` struct is maintainability and ease of adding new features in the future.",
