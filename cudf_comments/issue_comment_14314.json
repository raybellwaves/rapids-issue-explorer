        "body": "> So what are the other ones with speedups of 21%, 19%, etc.?\r\n\r\nSorry I should describe the benchmark better. This is NDS https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids-benchmarks/tree/dev/nds where we are running it in \"power run\" mode. In this case we are running queries in series one after the other in a cluster running spark rapids and 8xA100 GPUs. The results above show when one of the queries has significant regressions or speedups, and it also has a \"benchmark\" section at the end for the overall (sum of all query times compared between baseline and test). I ran these sets of tests three times, so the comparison tool is looking at the means and the variance and figuring out what is noise and what isn't.\r\n\r\nFrom the queries that have significant speedup, query9 and query88 are two queries we know are parquet/scan bound. Looking at traces for these, you'll mostly fine unsnap and parquet decode kernels. We see a lot of benefit here.\r\n\r\nIs this helping with your question @harrism, or am I missing it?",

We're leaning away from using a global/static host allocator because we want this behavior to be friendly/simple if dealing with multiple threads like Spark does. Also callers may want to use different host allocators.\r\n\r\nThe `host_mr` would be optional, and would use a non-pooled allocator by default. This avoids some of the concerns about determining a default host pool size, and how that would be handled by Python cudf and other consumers of the library. The `host_mr` should allow any of: a pinned host allocator (which is effectively the current behavior), a pooling pinned host allocator, or possibly even an adapter that implements an \"opportunistically pinned pool\" (Spark's desired use case; this would attempt allocating pinned memory, and fall back to allocating paged memory rather than failing to allocate).\r\n\r\n@abellina is going to investigate a bit further and pursue an implementation for review.",

Because `rmm::mr::pinned_host_memory_resource` is not a `device_memory_resource`, you will need to use the new `rmm::device_async_resource_ref` for the `host_mr` parameter in the Parquet reading APIs. We will be transitioning to that in all of RAPIDS, and in the interim, this will make the parameter compatible with both legacy `device_memory_resource`/`host_memory_resource` MRs AND the newer MRs like `pinned_host_memory_resource` that just implement the `cuda::async_memory_resource` policy.\r\n\r\nFor an example, see #14873 ",

For this approach I would love to sketch out the design changes to `hostdevice_vector` and `pinned_host_vector` that would be required to make use of an input `host_mr`. \r\n* Using a static memory resource in `pinned_host_vector` as in the [prototype](https://github.com/abellina/cudf/commit/a73fbd8a56901f7bb5d6f75ffdcb37f2fd37bdec) by @abellina seems to have the advantage of not adding additional plumbing to the IO modules that use the `hostdevice_vector` utility. \r\n\r\nI'm curious also to hear from @vuule.

        "body": "> The pinned mem allocator does not change the output for the user, it's purely an internal optimization\r\n\r\nThis is a good observation. My primary concern was about ensuring thread safety for the global/static approach (what happens if that allocator is changed while in use / before its previous allocations are freed?). If that's not a problem, then I'm okay with using a global/static pinned (pool) host memory resource. I thought the `host_mr` argument might give us more flexibility for our potential long term needs, but I don't want to overengineer for that case given how little we rely on pinned memory today.",

And this would still be limited the PQ reader, until we do the same for other components. I don't think we know at this point if this would bring additional benefit compared to a global API to set the resource. My proposal is to start with a global resource (that keeps the default behavior) and consider modifying the APIs once we see the effect of the global resource in production. Development would be pretty similar to the stream support (AFAICT), with a global default, and recently included stream parameters in most APIs.\r\n> \r\n> I have a separate concern about having a `host_mr` parameter that is not an equivalent to the existing mr param. The pinned mem allocator does not change the output for the user, it's purely an internal optimization. But this is maybe just a naming issue, very secondary at this point.\r\n\r\n@vuule could spark-rapids still provide its own memory pool for this? We wouldn't want a default pinned allocator to initialize, then uninitialized because it is going to be replaced by our own allocator.",
