        "body": "Hi all, apologies for late responses. I think we are missing a LIST type binary op to make that work. Basically you can get per list mean segmented sum and divided by `count_element` (not needed if LIST type is fixed size). But then you would need a custom kernel to perform per list centering. That is, to solve:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\n{{1, 2, 3}, {3, 1, 2}} - {2, 2}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would look something like:\r\n```c++\r\ngroup_idx = upper_bound(idx, offset.begin(), offset.end())-1;\r\ncentered[idx] = list[idx] - mean[group_idx];\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you could hack it together by repeating the per list mean by list sizes and perform the subtraction on the values of the LIST column. I don't recommend if the use case isn't urgent though.",
