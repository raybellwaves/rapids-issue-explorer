        "body": "Clarifying from Slack:\r\n\r\nThis is related to but not dependent on CUDA streams. CUDA streams (afaict) allow control of concurrent + parallel execution of ~heterogeneous CUDA task graphs. \r\n\r\nConsider a modern server (python, node, ruby, php, java, ...) GPU-accelerating requests of different type & size:\r\n\r\nThe relationship is:\r\n\r\n* Priority request - non-blocking of host event loops: Allow the host's event loop to not block on cudf calls, and instead proceed to handling the next server request, and get back to cudf when it's done. So the GPU crunching doesn't prevent the CPU from continuing, such as being able to tell clients  \"come back later\" and \"progress\" and \"here's some CPU calcs\". This helps prevents big tasks from making the system non-responsive and otherwise starving the system.\r\n\r\n* Maybe viable - non-blocking event loop w/ streams across requests: If each event context is really a sequence of cudf calls, CUDA streams would support better (e.g., parallel) execution of heterogenous tasks across concurrent events. This would help increase GPU utilization when tasks are of different sizes, so a bunch of tiny tasks wouldn't clog up a big box through low utilization / inversion of control.\r\n\r\n* User-level: Some better users may occasionally benefit from user-control of cuda streams:\r\n\r\n```\r\nawait asyncio.gather([ task1, task2, task3 ])\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Framework-level: Algo writers may be even more prone to writing such tasks.\r\n\r\nPriority order, IMO is:\r\n-- cudf not blocking the event loop\r\n-- a concurrency control for allowing concurrent task execution across event contexts\r\n\r\n```\r\ncudf.set_asyncio_concurrent_streams(10)\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr enabling user schedulers to map event context <> default cuda stream\r\n```\r\ncudf.set_stream_context_id( cudf.get_stream_context_id() )\r\ncudf.set_stream_policy(....)\r\n```\r\n\r\n-- DAG primitives like `gather`",
