We can't remove stream from scalar methods or any other public interfaces. \r\n\r\ncudf data types does not store streams (scalar, column, table, groupby). https://docs.rapids.ai/api/libcudf/nightly/developer_guide (libcudf API and Implementation \u2192 Streams). streams are passed to libcudf APIs. So, storing them inside data structure doesn't align well, and also execution should use stream (including memory allocation), IMO, data structures should not hold streams (although rmm differs from this). The constructors are called with streams because memory allocation and copy will execute on streams.",

        "body": "Could we take a step back here and ask why\r\n\r\n> When the class constructor is implicitly called (when the object is passed-by-value, for instance)\r\n\r\nis happening at all? cudf APIs are generally designed so that APIs should accept views rather than values. We don't have a `scalar_view` type (for [reasons](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/6558)) but we typically handle this by instead passing references to scalar objects. Are there places where we really should be passing scalars by value? If so, why? Perhaps I'm missing something obvious, but this seems like potentially a design smell to me. If a scalar is passed by value and a copy constructor is called that implies the construction of a new scalar and a new device allocation, which isn't usually desirable.\r\n\r\nIOW I don't know if there's a good reason for the copy constructor to not be explicit in the long run.
