        "body": "I've scoped this out and there's a couple of design caveats I would like to discuss before proceeding with an implementation. \r\n\r\nTL;DR: I am not sure how to do this in a way that is actually performant. \r\n\r\nThis function in pandas behaves more like a single large window over the entire data than a rolling window function like what is normally envisioned. That is to say that by default, each element of the result is the weighted average of *all* of those that come before it in the sequence.\r\n\r\nThe formula for a single result is quite clear from the [pandas documentation:](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/window.html#window-exponentially-weighted)\r\n\r\n<img width=\"461\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-07-28 at 11 32 12 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53796099/127361239-d11574d7-2308-44e9-9f9a-3e8db4cf3582.png\">\r\n\r\nThere's really two straightforward ways of computing this sequence and neither of them seem to really help us very much. \r\n\r\n1. Compute all the `y`s in parallel (each processing element is responsible for a single `y`). This doesn't help us because the work is very uneven, with the worst off thread (the last one) still needing to compute coefficients for the entire sequence and then reduce the result into a weighted average. \r\n2. Generate the results sequentially, keeping track of the numerator and denominator of the equation, and recognizing that each time we advance we need only multiply the numerator by a factor of `(1 - \u03b1)`, and multiply the denominator by the same `(1 - \u03b1)` and add `1` to get the next result. This is indeed how [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/f72c19b5db8773708d0cd384e8f3467163cd819b/pandas/_libs/window/aggregations.pyx#L1555-L1556) makes the calculation tractable. \r\n\r\nIn the case where we really are using this within a window function, this problem goes away, as long as the window size is small relative to the data size (each thread applies the above sequential algorithm for its window). We could thus implement this on top of rolling *technically*, but we can't just wrap that functionality with `window=len(data)` otherwise the performance will be abysmal. \r\n\r\nIt seems like what is needed here is a truly parallel algorithm that properly balances the work each computing element is doing across the moving average calculation.

Each element of the result is the result of dividing two things, but those things are the sums of sequences and those sequences are different for each element in question. Consider the first few denominators `d_i` and let `beta = (1 - alpha)`:\r\n\r\n`d_0 = 1`\r\n`d_1 = 1 + beta`\r\n`d_2 = 1 + beta + beta ** 2`\r\n\r\nIn general `d_n = sum(k = 0:n [beta ** n])` which is a finite series for which I do not think there is a closed form solution in terms of simple arithmetic operations. That said, one can see that \r\n\r\n`d_1 = beta * (1) + 1 = (beta * d_0) + 1`\r\n`d_2 = beta * (1 + beta) + 1 = (beta * d_1) + 1`\r\n\r\nMeaning each successive term is related to the last by \r\n\r\n`d_this = (beta * d_previous) + 1`\r\n\r\nWhich makes for an efficient *serial* algorithm for computing these terms without having to actually sum over an entirely new set of numbers. Unfortunately this doesn't seem to help us towards a thrust implementation because if we were trying to do an inclusive scan, we'd have this as our binary_op:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef f(d_previous, d_this):\r\n    return (beta * d_previous) + 1\r\nbeta = 0.1\r\nf(1, f(2,3))\r\n# 1.11\r\nf(f(1,2), 3)\r\n# 1.1\r\n```\r\n\r\nI believe this breaks the associativity needed for an inclusive scan.\r\n",

        "body": "Solving recurrence equations is in Guy Bleloch's classic paper \"Prefix Sums and their applications\". http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~blelloch/papers/Ble93.pdf (Section 1.4)\r\n\r\nThe trick is to maintain the intermediates as pairs, rather than as individual values. Let `b = 1-alpha`. For the numerator, the input is a list of pairs [(b, x_0), (b, x_1), (b, x_2), ...]. The numerator operator (in Python), is:  \r\n\r\n```\r\ndef f(pair_i, pair_j):\r\n    return (pair_i[0]*pair_j[0], pair_i[1]*pair_j[0] + pair_j[1])\r\n```\r\n\r\nTest input demonstrates associativity: \r\n```\r\n>>> beta=0.1\r\n>>> a=(beta, 1)\r\n>>> b=(beta, 2)\r\n>>> c=(beta, 3)\r\n>>> f(a, f(b, c))\r\n(0.0010000000000000002, 3.21)\r\n>>> f(f(a, b), c)\r\n(0.0010000000000000002, 3.21)\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo get the numerator out of the scan, after performing the inclusive scan, just extract all the second elements of the pairs.\r\n\r\nIntuitively, we are propagating the product of the `1-alpha`s separately from the summation.  This is a really simple recurrence, for which Blelloch gives a comprehensive proof and requirements on the operator. He also proves that higher order recurrences can be reduced and implemented with scans the same way, with the appropriate operator.\r\n\r\nThis paper is required reading, IMO. You will see scans everywhere once you start seeing them. :) \r\n\r\n(Note, implementation with Thrust is pretty simple -- just use a zip iterator with a constant iterator (1-alpha) and the input iterator and use a lambda that returns the modified pair as in the Python `f`.)",
