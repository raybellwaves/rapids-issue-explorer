        "body": "To add some context to this work, we recently added null sanitization checks in #14559, and also started simplifying nulls checking in #13312. \n\nIt's also worth mentioning that `purge_nonempty_null` has caused degenerate performance with copying columns with deeply nested structs (>16 levels). See #14363 for a patch that helped us avoid null sanitization for columns with no parent nulls. The performance observations are captured in issue #TBD.\n\nWe should continue to minimize the usage of `purge_nonempty_nulls`, as part of following our policy \"libcudf expects nested types to have sanitized null masks\" in the [developer guide](https://docs.rapids.ai/api/libcudf/stable/developer_guide)).",
