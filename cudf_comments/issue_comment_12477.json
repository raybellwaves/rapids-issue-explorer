        "body": "Spark also has a NullType, but it is not extensively used. It only shows up in cases where a null is explicitly put into the SQL with no type information at that point.  It is never used for any computation that I can see without casting it to a specific type first.  So like I said this is very minor and we are fine with out current solution where we store it as a INT8 that is null.",
