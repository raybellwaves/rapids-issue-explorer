        "body": "For context, the decision to disallow iteration over GPU objects is intentional -- it keeps users from accidentally triggering many host-device transfers (e.g. in a `for` loop) that are highly inefficient. This is problematic in some cases when column names are part of an object on the GPU that needs to be iterated over. The solution to this will likely require some code change in dask-cudf to convert the `StringIndex` into a type that is supported on the host.",
