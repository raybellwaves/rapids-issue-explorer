The query has about 25 invocations of `instr`, which amounts to 25 calls to `strings::contains()` per Spark input-row batch.\r\n2. Exploring the input column for `strings::contains()`: Out of a sampling of 102M rows, 99.98% of them were `\"_\"`, i.e. nominally blank.\r\n3. The input column had only a handful of unique values (in my sample). Here's a breakdown of their counts and lengths. (I have redacted the actual values.)\r\n```\r\n+--------------------+-----------------------+---------+\r\n|          input_str | char_length(input_str)|   count |\r\n+--------------------+-----------------------+---------+\r\n|                  _ |                      1|102542310|\r\n| AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA |                     54|    13611|\r\n| BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB |                     22|     1404|\r\n| XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX |                     17|      702|\r\n| YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY |                    149|      390|\r\n| ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ |                    104|       39|\r\n+--------------------+-----------------------+---------+\r\n```\r\n4. The column seems to have only ASCII characters.\r\n5. The average string length is `1.008`, vastly skewed by the 99% \"_\" value.  Ignoring that row, the average length is `52.02`.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure why/how `finder_warp_parallel_fn` or `contains_warp_parallel_fn` kernels landed up in the slow path, given that the average string length seems not to exceed the warp-parallelism threshold (`64`).\r\n\r\nI *think* @revans2's changes have seen to it that `strings::contains` is called correctly.  Thereafter, it *should* call the string-per-thread version.\r\n\r\nI haven't run a profile on the sample yet. I'll try get that going tomorrow.",

        "body": "I've generated a local dataset with the search key distributions in much the same way as that of the reported slow case. (This includes the order of if-else clauses, with a similar match rate.)\r\n\r\nAt 4M rows, with an average string length of 256, with the search keys of 12-char average lengths, the total runtimes are a near match.  It's not looking like the kernel runtimes have an appreciable effect on the total runtime.  If there's anything afflicting the `block-per-string` approach, it might also be affecting the existing `warp-per-string`.  \r\n\r\nNSight Compute analysis did seem to indicate the following warning regarding `Long Scoreboard Stalls`:\r\n>```On average, each warp of this kernel spends 11.7 cycles being stalled waiting for a scoreboard dependency on a L1TEX (local, global, surface, texture) operation. Find the instruction producing the data being waited upon to identify the culprit. To reduce the number of cycles waiting on L1TEX data accesses verify the memory access patterns are optimal for the target architecture, attempt to increase cache hit rates by increasing data locality (coalescing), or by changing the cache configuration. Consider moving frequently used data to shared memory. This stall type represents about 63.5% of the total average of 18.4 cycles between issuing two instructions```\r\n\r\nI'm trying to understand what can be changed here, but I'm wondering if we should be considering an algorithmic fix:\r\n1. We might consider what @jlowe has mentioned vis-a-vis employing short-circuit evaluations of `CASE WHEN`.\r\n2. A longer term change might involve pre-processing the input strings for searches.",

That isn't accurate.\r\n\r\nMore correctly, the profiles of the Spark tasks indicate that the `contains` kernel is being called 30K times per task (as per how the user query is written), presumably around 25 times per input batch (once per `CASE WHEN` clause).  Each call runs in milliseconds, but the number of calls pushes the total time spent in said kernel to several seconds.\r\n\r\nEven a small improvement to the kernel is likely to amplify, at that scale.",

        "body": "The first approach (processing 1 string/threadblock instead of 1 string/warp) was a bust.  At the user's average string size of 144 characters, it appeared that too many threads in the block had too little to do.\r\n\r\nThe second approach (processing N strings in the same kernel, instead of running the single \"contains_warp_parallel_fn\" kernel N times) should have reduced the processing time (by amortizing the costs of kernel launch).  This seemed like a bust.  Tests at the user site indicated that this was taking slightly longer as well.\r\n\r\nThe current thought (hat tip to @nvdbaranec) is that this might have something to do with null string inputs.  It's possible that GPU occupancy reduces when there are more null input rows than non-null.  The null-threads exit early, and wait for the completion of non-null threads.  \r\nIt might be possible to increase occupancy by reducing the threads-per-block for the kernel launch.  \r\nI'm awaiting clarification on the user's actual null counts. I'm trying to test the behaviour with nulls separately.",
