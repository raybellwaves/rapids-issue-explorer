        "body": "Diving into this issue with @PointKernel led us to figure out this is more complex than it appears. In general, `distinct` and `distinct_count` should share the same configuration parameters, but as of now, they do not. The configuration parameters that appear in these APIs are:\r\n\r\n1. `null_policy` : `{EXCLUDE, INCLUDE}`\r\n2. `nan_policy` : `{NAN_IS_NULL, NAN_IS_VALID}`\r\n3. `null_equality` : `{EQUAL, UNEQUAL}`\r\n4. `nan_equality` : `{ALL_EQUAL, UNEQUAL}`\r\n\r\nThese 4 knobs all interplay with each other, and the right way to do this would be:\r\n\r\n- Add 1 and 2 to the implementation of `distinct`, which currently exposes 3 and 4, while also using the new row comparators\r\n- Write a common function inspired from `distinct` that builds a hash map, to be shared with `distinct_count`\r\n- `distinct` uses the actual map and post-processes to build the result table, `distinct_count` just directly returns the size of the map\r\n- This also helps update `distinct_count` to the new experimental comparators\r\n- Start sharing tests/benchmarks between both these functions as they will essentially be sharing the same code path\r\n",
