For instance, should the `null_mask` or `nullable` properties even be accessible, or are they implementation details? `Series.set_mask` is already deprecated. Are there any public APIs where a bitmask is a reasonable expectation, or should all public APIs involving masks operate on boolean masks even if that is less performant (that's my opinion, IMO all bitmask operations should be exclusively internal, but perhaps there's a strong performance need to expose those).",
