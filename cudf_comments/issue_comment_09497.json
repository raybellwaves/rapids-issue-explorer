Not a bug but having this may improve stability/reduce hidden bugs.\r\n\r\nEdit: I just realize that the current Java code is doing very well in handling null output from `getData`. If throwing exception on LIST/STRUCT type input, it is still not guaranteed that the output of other types will never be null. In addition, with exception being thrown, the callers also need to deal more with the complex type handling to not call `getData()` on LIST/STRUCT. Overall, this issue may not be very beneficial.",
