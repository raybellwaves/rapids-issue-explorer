Here's the command to install nightly:\r\n\r\n```\r\npip install -i https://pypi.anaconda.org/rapidsai-wheels-nightly/simple cudf-cu11  # or cu-12\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using `conda`, the install command is a bit different:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconda create --solver=libmamba -n rapids-24.02 -c rapidsai-nightly -c conda-forge -c nvidia  \\\r\n    cudf=24.02 python=3.10 cuda-version=11.8  # or 12.0\r\n```\r\n",
