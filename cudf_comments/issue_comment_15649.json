I have a vague recollection of trying to remove this at one point and realizing that there were dependent changes required to make that happen. It looks like you've started adding deprecations for this in #15650, which is a great way to check this. Since our test suite runs with warnings as errors, if there are internal usages of concatenating indexes we'll see them as test failures there. Let's see how that goes!",

        "body": "OK awesome. It looks like you've started trying to catch those warnings in #15650, which is a good way to make sure that you've tracked down all the cases. However, I don't think we want to merge that exactly as is, because if we do then our users will start seeing a lot of warnings from APIs that they can't do anything about. We do want to verify that `cudf.concat` is itself going to throw the warning when users directly use it in a way that will be unsupported in the future, but we want to make sure that users don't see warnings due to our own code internally using deprecated functionality. We should start working through those APIs to see how best to rewrite them so that they don't rely on the deprecated functionality anymore. Does that make sense? Feel free to ask questions here (or on the PR)!",

        "body": "Good analysis! You've found most of the relevant places, but what we ought to also look at is how dask implements concatenation for pandas indexes. It looks dask uses append for pandas indexes. You can see the implementation in dask for pandas dataframes [here](https://github.com/dask/dask/blob/main/dask/dataframe/backends.py#L562). The append method [was removed for Series and DataFrame in pandas 2.0](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/whatsnew/v2.0.0.html#removal-of-prior-version-deprecations-changes), but [it still exists for indexes](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.Index.append.html). So what we probably want to do is update the dispatch in the dask_cudf backend that you linked to to use the index append method.\r\n\r\nIn the long run, we might want to discuss with pandas developers whether there should be more uniformity between the different types and whether they use append or concat. @mroeschke might know how and why pandas ended up in the current heterogeneous state. However, any such changes in pandas would be a longer-term thing, so we should be able to proceed with the above plan in the interim.",
