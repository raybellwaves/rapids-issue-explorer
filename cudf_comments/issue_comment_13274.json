The way I _thought_ lists in cudf work is that every rows must have the same type, so your first entry has type `List (List (List (List (int | None))))`. Now, _I_ think that `List None` does not have the same type as `None`, and so I would have thought that writing `[[None], None]` would not be allowed because the first entry has type `List None` and the second has type `None`. However, it seems like arrow treats `None` as an arbitrary placeholder at any depth which blows a hole through the type system in my book.\r\n\r\nI suppose the type is something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndata List a = None | [a | None]\r\n```",
