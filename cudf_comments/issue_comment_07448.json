        "body": "> This still fails, but differently now. I end up with `ValueError: Merge operands must have same number of join key columns `\r\n\r\nI think the narrow issue is that `Series._loc_to_iloc` doesn't have a carve-out for desugaring tuple keys, so they are treated like a list-like. This patch fixes the narrow issue:\r\n```patch\r\ndiff --git a/python/cudf/cudf/core/series.py b/python/cudf/cudf/core/series.py\r\nindex c7bc97edd6..f55fd460e4 100644\r\n--- a/python/cudf/cudf/core/series.py\r\n+++ b/python/cudf/cudf/core/series.py\r\n@@ -403,7 +403,9 @@ class _SeriesLocIndexer(_FrameIndexer):\r\n                 arg = cudf.MultiIndex.from_pandas(arg)\r\n \r\n             return _indices_from_labels(self._frame, arg)\r\n-\r\n+        elif isinstance(self._frame.index, cudf.MultiIndex) and isinstance(arg, tuple):\r\n+            arg = cudf.MultiIndex.from_tuples([arg])\r\n+            return _indices_from_labels(self._frame, arg)\r\n         else:\r\n             arg = cudf.core.series.Series(cudf.core.column.as_column(arg))\r\n             if arg.dtype in (bool, np.bool_):\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut doesn't address the broader issue that multiindex labels are not handled well: it breaks as soon as you say `gs[[(1, 3), (2, 3)]]`, say.\r\n",
