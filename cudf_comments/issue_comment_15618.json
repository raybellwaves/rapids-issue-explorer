        "body": "Apologies for the slow response here. The main reason not to call it directly in `__array__` is that it would be surprising to users if `np.asarray(cudf.RangeIndex(...))` returned a cupy array instead of a numpy array, especially since there are types that are representable in cudf and in numpy but not in cupy so the above conversion would actually fail if we implicitly converted to cupy instead of numpy.",
