        "body": "One issue that was raised was that a `DeviceMemoryBuffer` could instead be composed using a java \"MemoryResource\", rather than having to create other classes like `CudaMemoryBuffer` to accomplish this. We could then pass other resources like a potential \"AsyncMemoryResource\" instance, or some hierarchy of other resources (the logging resource + pool for example). Ideally this issue would tackle this problem as well.",
