        "body": "This will likely require some nontrivial changes, like adding a sequential index column before joining, then sorting after the join? Or perhaps some intermediate sorting of the join indices (can't recall the implementation details to know if this is viable at the moment). Either way, preserving order for a hash join is not ideal for performance, which is why this hasn't been done yet. I am not sure if there's any better way -- we did find some clever ways to implement `drop_duplicates` in an order-preserving way, and perhaps the same can be done here. I suspect libcudf changes will be needed to resolve this (at least, in an efficient way). If you'd like me to pursue this, please let me know.
