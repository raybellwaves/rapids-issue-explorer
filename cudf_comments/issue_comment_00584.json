If we'd prefer to consolidate discussion on #479 we can close this again and reopen that, but offhand it seems like #479 grew into a much more involved discussion about defining a style guide and enabling clang-tidy with some minimal configuration seems like a simpler goal to start with.",

        "body": "Thank you Mark for adding me to this discussion. Yes, I'm certainly interested in a more uniform tidy config across RAPIDS!\r\n\r\nBTW, we already have clang-tidy running as part of CI for cuml for almost a year now (though not super stringent, yet). cuML CI is [here](https://github.com/rapidsai/cuml/blob/branch-21.10/ci/checks/style.sh#L92). However, when it was introduced, we were at clang v8.0.1 which wasn't particularly great with .cu/.cuh files! So, the [tidy wrapper script](https://github.com/rapidsai/cuml/blob/branch-21.10/cpp/scripts/run-clang-tidy.py) had to take in a bunch of hacks :(. If someone can pick up this flow, improve and generalize it for RAPIDS-wide usage, that'd be awesome.\r\n\r\nFinally, I'm not particularly attached to these scripts or a particular style (eg: google, cpp-core, etc) and will happily accept if there's a better solution for RAPIDS. However, I'd like for atleast all the key devs to be involved and their requirements heard before finalizing on a tidy style guide. Because in my personal opinion, tidying has a bigger benefit in terms of code uniformity and readability, especially for folks working across RAPIDS projects.",

I know that cuML is already running clang-tidy, but they also have significant logic built around wrapping the clang-tidy invocation so I assume that they are also doing some preprocessing to only lint the files that they can compile. I could be wrong, though, and perhaps there's a simpler path here.\r\n\r\nEDIT: It looks like [cuML is skipping cu files altogether](https://github.com/rapidsai/cuml/blob/branch-23.02/cpp/scripts/run-clang-tidy.py#L43).",
