The Java code does a full translation from a Java tree to a native tree in an explicit `compile()` step, so nothing in the Java layer should need to change.  It should only be a change in the JNI native code layer that explicitly tracks the AST sub-expressions.  Now that it's coded and working, not a high priority from my perspective. \ud83d\ude04 ",
