        "body": "Thanks @JacoCheung for sharing these results.\r\n\r\n* Would you please explain the \"features\" and \"row_group\" information in the table you shared above? I'm not sure how to interpret this information. I would like to convert it to a list of the columns and their types to better evaluate your observations.\r\n* Did you perform OS cache clearing before each read operation? Generally we recommend this to make sure the order of read operations does not impact the speed of each operation.\r\n* Would you please share nsys profiles of the 'criteo' data set in particular? (If you like we can follow up on profile or dataset exchange on Slack?)\r\n* It looks like you are using the RMM pool - that's great! How does the CUDA memory resource compare?",
