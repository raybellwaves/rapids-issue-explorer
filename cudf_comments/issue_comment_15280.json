        "body": "@revans2 thank you for sharing this update - it's hilarious! We will need to brainstorm about our options here. \r\n* Let invalid JSON get corrected. @revans2 are you willing to accept this behavior?\r\n* libcudf could modify the normalization FST to avoid dropping the whitespace that occurs within a JSON value. We would need to add more states to do this, so it would cost more time and memory. @shrshi what do you think?\r\n* Spark-RAPIDS could run a validity check and flag invalid rows, but perhaps this would not work for the cases where Spark needs to recover records from invalid lines (e.g. `{\"A\":1}{\"B\":1 2 3}`). @revans2 what do you think?",
