        "body": "The issue is we try to JIT compile the UDF via Numba and the UDF provided can't be properly lowered by Numba into a GPU kernel. It can't be lowered because the function being passed isn't a kernel, but is instead an array / column level function of `median`.\r\n\r\nWe could make the typical Pandas way of `apply` work via iteration, but it would be painfully slow in the case of a large number of windows of small sizes.",
