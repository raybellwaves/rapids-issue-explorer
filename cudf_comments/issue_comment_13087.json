        "body": "Thank you @lmeyerov for raising this, and thank you for joining into the Slack discussion. \r\n\r\nHere are some points from the discussion:\r\n* RAPIDS is working on a new `pylibcudf` API that has low-level bindings to libcudf and will enable CUDA stream control. We expect that the appropriate usage pattern of streams in Python could accelerate your high-column-count transformations, even if it's not host-async\r\n* `asyncio` is associated with [high overhead](https://rapids-goai.slack.com/archives/C5E06F4DC/p1681368614519629?thread_ts=1680710488.795869&cid=C5E06F4DC) for short-running tasks, and most column transformations are likely to be small tasks \r\n* When CUDA streams are exposed in the python API, users will be able to write their own [asyncio coroutines](https://rapids-goai.slack.com/archives/C5E06F4DC/p1681372363833429?thread_ts=1680710488.795869&cid=C5E06F4DC).",
