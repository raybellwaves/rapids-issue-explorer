        "body": "I think ultimately we want to deprecate/remove the `.from_pandas()` API and be able to support constructing from other \"DataFrameLike\" objects (e.g., Pandas, Modin, Vaex) via the `.from_dataframe()` API. Currently, that depends on https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/pull/11392. \r\n\r\nAs for `.from_arrow()`, I'd rather we have a more _explicit_ `.from_arrow` constructor than an _implicit_ one that goes through the constructor. I understand that Pandas does not have the equivalent `.from_arrow()` method, but neither does it allow passing pyarrow tables as input to the `DataFrame` constructor (AFAICT). What do you think?",
