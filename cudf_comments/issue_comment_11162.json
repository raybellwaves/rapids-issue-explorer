        "body": "Thank you @revans2 for starting this discussion of Spark's `array_sort` API and it's `func` argument. The documentation you shared includes two examples. Are these typical of the user-provided `func` arguments - are there other patterns you could share?\r\n\r\n`case when left < right then -1 when left > right then 1 else 0 end`: is this just a verbose write-out of the default behavior?\r\n`case when left is null and right is null then 0 when left is null then -1 when right is null then 1 when left < right then 1 when left > right then -1 else 0 end`: is this kind of elaborate null handling typical of how the `func` argument is used?",
