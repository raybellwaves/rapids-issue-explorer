We have to check whether there can be nulls otherwise we'd break downstream in the reader. So it either has to be `has_nulls()` or `nullable()`. The former incurs a kernel call for each column. That's why the latter was chosen. With the understanding, that if the user knew there wouldn't be nulls, they'd drop the mask before passing it in.",

        "body": "Sorry about the delay in the response. I understand why nullable was chosen, but the issue I run into is that it is very easy to have something that is nullable, but has no nulls. This happens quite often in Spark. We can analyze the query we are able to tell that something will never have a null in it, but the last cudf call was not able to make the same decision and ended up including a validity column. For example we could filter out all of the nulls from a column. In spark we know that all of the nulls are gone, but cudf just called `filter` on it. It has no knowledge that the boolean mask is correlated to the validity column in any way. I just knows that the input has nulls so there is the possibility that the output will have nulls, and it needs to allocate a validity mask. If you don't do this then I have to figure out a way to walk through all of the columns/child columns and strip out the validity mask if it exists for things that I know don't need it, which then I would also want to run a kernel on it to be sure that there was no bug in the code.",

For ORC/Parquet ATM we generally lean on the side of reducing the memory use, so it would make sense to have a slight perf overhead to avoid allocating the null masks.\r\nI've just realized that the memory use impact would be ~1%, so I'm not sure if my reasoning stands.

        "body": "@revans2 Then how about a libcudf API (maybe called `prune_masks`) that takes a table and removes null masks from all columns that have no nulls. This API could be optimized to call a single kernel for the table rather than separate kernels for each column. Filter your tables through it before passing to anything. It will be a one stop optimized solution for all cuIO writers and more (like calling joins on it etc.)\r\n\r\n@vuule This doesn't need extra memory because this is the writer. It might create a slightly larger file. But if there are no nulls then all the definition values will be 1 and running it through RLE will all but remove it. Think 8 bytes per 1 MB page.",
