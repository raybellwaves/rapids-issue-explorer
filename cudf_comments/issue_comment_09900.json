        "body": "Quoting @vyasr from https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/pull/9867#discussion_r768192180:\r\n\r\n> I agree that a copy to host that preserves more type information is probably preferable. I'm not aware of any API that returns a pandas DataFrame, but we do return pandas objects in some places. One example is DataFrame.columns, which returns a pandas Index, probably based on the same consideration of not wanting to put the data on device. Personally from an API design perspective I would prefer not to return pandas objects and would rather return something like a dict, but I can see that causing more friction for users switching between pandas and cudf.",
