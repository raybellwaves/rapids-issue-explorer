        "body": "I am also curious to understand this problem. From the original description it doesn't seem like the request is stemming from some complex workflow where some groups are \"discovered\" to be unnecessary, but rather to optimize user workflows even when users invoke the function with suboptimal regexes. Naively this seems like a use case where we should be aiming to educate users as to best practices for performance rather than optimizing additional code paths, i.e. we should be documenting that including unnecessary groups in the regex will impact performance. That would be consistent with a lot of our messaging around cuDF Python where there are often ways to do things with pandas that would translate to slow cuDF solutions, and we try to document and socialize knowledge about faster ways to do those things in cuDF without trying to optimize all the slower ways. Maybe I'm missing a key reason that this use case is different, though.",

Spark provides a SQL function [regexp_extract](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/api/pyspark.sql.functions.regexp_extract.html) with the signature `regexp_extract(str, pattern, idx)`. This function was requested in [SPARK-8255](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-8255) to expose the equivalent Java regexp functionality. It doesn't look like too much thought was given to the inefficiency of this approach. The function has existed since Spark 1.5.0 so it is likely that people are using it. We do support this function in the RAPIDS Accelerator for Spark already but it would be more efficient if we could just request a single group to be extracted.\r\n\r\n",
