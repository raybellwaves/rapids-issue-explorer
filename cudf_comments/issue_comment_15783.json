        "body": "I had a call with a couple folks from Sentry (who create Codecov), Sabiha and Vlad. We talked through a few topics related to coverage in RAPIDS.\r\n\r\n- Codecov's carryforward option may help us with the problems we face with only running CI on a nightly basis. This may resolve (3) above. We may want to use `-F <component>` (like `-F cudf`) so that we can more easily determine coverage for each part of a repository.\r\n\r\n- I requested a feature in Codecov. The UI for Codecov should have an option to stay in sync with the GitHub default branch (currently https://app.codecov.io/gh/rapidsai/cudf/ uses branch-23.06, which is a year old). Currently the branch must be manually adjusted, and we don't want to add work to the release process. Vlad will see what can be done on their side (a UI option to stay in sync with GitHub would be ideal).\r\n\r\n- I reported a bug in Codecov: the \"latest commit\" reported for [branch-24.06](https://app.codecov.io/gh/rapidsai/cudf/tree/branch-24.06) on Codecov is 2 weeks old. However, there are newer coverage reports on [the commit list for branch-24.06](https://app.codecov.io/gh/rapidsai/cudf/commits?branch=All%20branches). Vlad said this seems to be a bug and they'll take a look.\r\n\r\n- On the RAPIDS side, [we're getting rate limited](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/actions/runs/9124031981/job/25087473694#step:9:77) during Codecov uploads, which prevents us from getting full coverage reports on every nightly test run.

I think we may get nightly coverage reports for `branch-24.06` since that's currently active in CI, but most new PRs are targeting `branch-24.08` so we may be out-of-sync for a while until the 24.06 release is complete and we move our nightly CI runs to `branch-24.08`.",
