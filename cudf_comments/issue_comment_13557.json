        "body": "We also have a related problem in the C++ layer, where we [sort indices and then gather in places like `segmented_sort_by_key_common`](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/blob/84578d793e4bf5a0924766d39ff717f5d9d71820/cpp/src/sort/segmented_sort_impl.cuh#L302C24-L302C52). At the libcudf level, we have to consider nulls and nontrivial types (where a gather is needed for handling those) but the same general idea applies: sort directly wherever possible. https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/pull/13669#discussion_r1268276705",
